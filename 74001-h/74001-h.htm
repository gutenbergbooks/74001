<p>I am indebted to you for many
great obligations, most
illustrious and great men; and
lately you have done me the
honour to confer a most noble
and unexpected favour upon me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
It is but just that I should by
words thank those to whom I
am incapable of making any
other return; and such a testimony
of gratitude I will shew
them as long as I live. It is
proper that, being publickly
graced by your favours, I should
make a public acknowledgment,
and give some pledge of my
gratitude, however mean and
inadequate. Receive therefore,
most illustrious and excellent
men, and deign to receive favourably,
this first though feeble
proof of my diligence in my
new office. May the Almighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
enable me to promote the public
interest of the academy by
more considerable and more valuable
productions, and may the
hopes which you have conceived
of me, venerable fathers of your
country, and the hopes which
the people have conceived concerning
this new professorship,
be fulfilled to general satisfaction.
May the propitious Deity likewise
favour all your public and
private undertakings, and shower
all his choicest blessings both upon
you and yours, and the whole
commonwealth. And cease not,
reverend fathers, to make happy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
by your constant benevolence
and favour, a man entirely devoted
to the service of your excellencies.</p>

<p><i>The occasion of this discourse, and
the choice of the materials, will sufficiently
appear from the discourse itself:
therefore, courteous reader, I shall not
trespass upon thy patience by a long preface.</i></p>

<p><i>I have long since read many treatises
and dissertations concerning the health of
the studious; but of all the authors, who
have treated this subject, the only one
who has acquitted himself to my satisfaction
is <span class="smcap">Bernard Ramazini</span>: for
I have not yet had an opportunity of reading
the work of the celebrated <span class="smcap">Pujatus</span>,
a man who in other respects has deserved
highly of the medicinal science; but whose
treatise upon this subject is, I find, neither
praised by the journals nor by his
friends. Nor is the work of <span class="smcap">Ramazini<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></span>
compleat; since he has left more topicks
untouched than he has elucidated. I have
therefore undertaken an important, an
agreeable, and even a new subject; and I
hope I shall not appear unequal to it; but
it will be sufficient to have pointed out the
road at a distance to learned travellers; they
will soon be able of themselves to shew the
unknown paths; which is my earnest wish
and desire. In this treatise there will occur
many passages transcribed verbatim
from <span class="smcap">Celsus</span>, <span class="smcap">Gaubius</span>, and other eminent
men, and that even without distinguishing
them by quotation. This plagiarism
will, I hope, be excused, because
I looked upon it as a sort of profanation to
alter their words, as they were extreamly
eloquent, and admirably adapted to my
purpose: besides, it was improper to disgust
the reader by too great a number
of quotations.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">When I consider with myself
how many and how great
men have formerly ascended
this chair, with how general an applause
they apply’d to the education of
youth, and how every branch of erudition
has been cultivated to such advantage
by the present set of teachers,
into whose learned order I am this day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
admitted by the great favour and indulgence
of our senate; whilst I at
the same time reflect how much this
new situation differs from my former
manner of living, in which as I had
willingly pass’d a considerable part of
my life, I had determin’d to continue
to my old age; when I reflect upon
all these circumstances, a tremor seizes
my limbs, and my voice falters. But
because from the very foundation of this
respectable academy, custom, which
governs all things, and your expectation
requires it of me, embolden’d by
your kindness, I will make trial of my
abilities.</p>

<p>Being a new member, and ascending
a new chair, I propos’d to speak
of the connexion between physic and
other academical studies, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
my design to explain what it borrows
from them, and what it contributes to
them in its turn.</p>

<p>It would be a pleasure to me, reverend
pastors of the church, and illustrious
professors of divinity, to declare
aloud how much physick is indebted
to religion; I would gladly
vindicate the principles of physicians
from the imputations of ancient calumny,
and prove that religion is strongly
supported by a science, which, being
totally conversant in the contemplation
of an admirable creature, demonstrates
from the wonderful mechanism
of a man in health, and the
surprising cures of the sick, the existence
and great wisdom of the Supreme
Artificer, and that even to the most
obstinate. Do men forget the Deity?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Physicians stand forth, and theology
is entirely reviv’d; for who have spoken
more truth, or in a sublimer stile concerning
God, than they? There would
be no end, were I to cite them all;
but I must not pass over in silence
<span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>, the first who ever asserted
that fate produc’d nothing, but
that all those events, which we call
fortuitous, are regulated by the will
of God: the next to him is <span class="smcap">Galen</span>,
who diffusively proves, that the existence
of God is demonstrated by the
position of the thumb alone; and calls
his treatise concerning the use of the
parts, a monument to the glory of the
Deity: to him must be added <span class="smcap">Polychrestus</span>,
to whom the illustrious
sir-name of <i>Lover of God</i> was given,
on account of his great piety: <span class="smcap">Boyle</span>,
who wrote excellent works himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and founded an admirable institution
for the promotion of religion, which
he nobly endow’d; his friend <span class="smcap">Sydenham</span>;
the immortal <span class="smcap">Lock</span>; <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span>,
who carried his piety so far,
that he was not entirely free from
superstition; the admirable <span class="smcap">Tralles</span>;
and my dear and worthy friend <span class="smcap">Haller</span>,
who in an excellent treatise has
asserted the utility of religion in a
manly stile, as usual, and exerts himself
to the utmost to promote its cause.</p>

<p>Physicians indeed laugh at the idle
tales of old women, at the extravagancies
of the vulgar, and thereby incur
the censure of weak and superstitious
people; they deride the inventions of
imagination; and whilst every divine
lays down his own opinion as the rule
of truth, physicians make a jest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the phantoms which these set up for
religion, and refuse to embrace a cloud
for a Juno: thence all these clamours,
these accusations, these reproaches, and
these calumnies. But if some of our
society have in fact been led astray by
error, which I am sorry to say cannot
be denied, the severe censure of their
colleagues has soon convinced the public
how much they disapprov’d of
their principles.</p>

<p>It would be a pleasure to me, most
learned professor of morality, whom
to address by the tender name of
father-in-law is my greatest happiness;
it would be a pleasure to me,
I say, to treat to the best of my abilities
of the connexion between the
knowledge of morals and of health;
how near the relation is between them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
how exact the concatenation in every
respect. This is certainly both an agreeable
and useful undertaking: nor
is it altogether new; for <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>
has in his whole treatise concerning
diet, done his utmost to prove
that souls are the same in all men, and
that the various degrees of wisdom and
folly proceed from the different temperament
of their bodies; and <span class="smcap">Galen</span>,
who has admirably demonstrated the
power of the body over the mind and
the motions of the will, desired the
teachers of philosophy, sixteen ages
ago, to send all persons of bad morals
to him to be cur’d<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Should I be ever so full, most
learned professor of jurisprudence, I
could not entirely display the connexion
between us; for whether a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
legislator regulates a commonwealth,
or whether a judge upon the bench
weighs questions of civil law, or criminal
and ecclesiastical causes, in the
ballance of Themis, there occur cases,
and those not a few, in which he
cannot do without the assistance of
our art.</p>

<p>It would be necessary to lay open
the greatest part of natural knowledge,
most profound professor of philosophy,
were I to treat of all that it has
in common with physick; for you well
know that both the cure of diseases,
and the contemplation of the nature
of things, had their beginnings from
the same authors. We are therefore
inform’d that many of the professors
of natural philosophy were well skilled
in physick, and that the most illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
of these were <span class="smcap">Pythagoras</span>,
<span class="smcap">Empedocles</span>, and <span class="smcap">Democritus</span>.
<span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span> was the first who separated
these studies; but he did not
separate them in such a manner as to
pull them asunder entirely, but so as
to split that comprehensive science into
several more minute members, that
many might cultivate divided, what
one could not learn entire; but that
neither should desert what nature made
inseparable.</p>

<p>That part of this science, which
considers body merely as body, has
retain’d the name of natural philosophy:
others went by various names,
according to the different sorts of bodies
of which they treated. The human
body is the object of physick,
which without natural philosophy is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
lame; for he is but a dunce in the
art of healing, who is not acquainted
with the forces of bodies, and the laws
of motion: nor do professors of physick
care to undertake the education
of those, who are ignorant of natural
philosophy. But if physick is greatly
indebted to this science, it can in some
respects return the favour, and physicians
have return’d it in many instances:
for <span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>, who first satisfactorily
explain’d the phænomena
of electricity, was a physician, as was
likewise <span class="smcap">Boyle</span>, who promoted natural
knowledge more than any other
philosopher; and <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>, whose
experiments upon the elements have
given a new face to this science; and
to pass over many others in silence,
the illustrious <span class="smcap">Muschembroek</span>, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
is universally allow’d to surpass all
others in this article.</p>

<p>And there is some connexion, though
perhaps not so close, between your
studies and physick, illustrious professors
of history and languages; for
what physician would not be asham’d
to be ignorant of history and the humanities?
Who would not be desirous
of consulting the Arabian physicians
in the originals, as none of them has
hitherto been faithfully translated?
Are there not likewise certain parts of
history, which physick alone can throw
proper lights upon? Is not <span class="smcap">Celsus</span> a
physician, whose works all that are
desirous of speaking Latin in perfection,
study night and day? <span class="smcap">Pliny</span>, in whom
we meet not merely with helps for acquiring
the Latin language, but with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the purest Latinity, though he did not
practise physic, understood it perfectly,
and is entirely taken up in explaining
it. <span class="smcap">Areteus</span>, whom we respect as
a master of the healing art, is conspicuous
for the elegance of his Greek.
<span class="smcap">Galen</span> has an eloquence peculiar to
himself. So has <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>. And
those who cultivate the Arabic language,
boast that it is no where to be
found in greater purity than in the
writings of physicians.</p>

<p>It appear’d to me at first sight, that
on so copious a subject it would be easy
to make an oration; but upon maturer
deliberation I began to think quite
otherwise; and so, having laid down
a burthen too heavy for my shoulders,
and left it to more sublime geniuses,
I kept to my practice, <i>my labour is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
here engaged, and not my eloquence</i>; and,
having resigned the hopes of declaiming
like an able orator, or soothing
your ears with the allurement of words,
I have chosen this subject, as capable
of pleasing you by its own force; and
as it is sufficient barely to lay it before
you, it requires no ornaments:</p>

<p class="noindent">And addressing myself to learned men

of studious men; and here again I must
request your indulgence:</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But whilst I was hurried about to attend
a crowd of patients, I had no
leisure to polish my work; therefore
I have without method thrown together
my thoughts and observations on
this useful topic.</p>

<p>It is an old complaint, that study,
though essentially necessary to the
mind, is hurtful to the body; and
<span class="smcap">Celsus</span> has intimated the necessity of
a remedy. Those that are of weak
constitutions, says he, as most studious
men are, should take greater care than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
others, that what is impaired by application
to their studies may be repair’d
by attention to their constitutions. And
<span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>, an admirable judge of
what is right and becoming, declares it
to be a shame, that the learned should
spend days and nights in useless investigations,
and at the same time neglect
the art of preserving their health; being,
doubtless, ignorant that the healing
science was formerly look’d upon as a
part of wisdom, and that those chiefly
requir’d medical assistance, who have
impair’d their bodily strength by anxious
thought and watchfulness.</p>

<p>There are two principal sources,
from whence all the sufferings of the
studious flow; the constant exercise
and application of the mind, and the
continual rest of the body; for they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
as indolent in body, as they are busy
and active in mind. By enumerating
the ills, that arise from both causes, a
dreadful crop of diseases will be display’d.</p>

<p>Let metaphysicians bewilder themselves
in inquiries, how the mind governs
the body, and is govern’d by
the latter in its turn; physicians, descending
to considerations of less importance,
but of greater certainty, perhaps,
and little sollicitous about the
causes of this mutual government, and
but confining their inquiries to phænomena,
know by experience, that
certain emotions of the mind necessarily
arise from certain conditions of the
body, and that by particular emotions
in the mind particular changes are unavoidably
produc’d in the body, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
that whilst the mind thinks, some part
of the brain is stretch’d. We make no
other inquiry; it would be of no use
to know any thing farther.</p>

<p>So close is the connexion between
mind and body, that we cannot well
conceive the operations of the one independent
of some correspondence with
the other. For as the senses are incapable
of conveying the materials of
thought to the soul, without the motion
both of their own fibres and those
of the brain, so, whilst the mind revolves
these cogitations, the organs of
the brain are more or less stimulated
to act, stretch’d, and have oscillatory
motions excited in them. The mind
agitates the machine; and these are the
labours of the medullary part, which,
being so tender, does not suffer the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
less by these motions; and every man
easily feels that in himself, which the
strongest arms experience after the
most violent exercise.</p>

<p>For which of you, that has been
addicted to a studious life, has not often
found, after intense thought, that the
innermost part of the brain has been
affected by a troublesome heat, and
intense pain, such as the muscles feel
when fatigu’d with long labour? Nor
does the medullary part of the brain
suffer alone, but the very eyes themselves
can perceive the force of the
thinking soul, extended beyond the
brain: for whilst we look upon a man
that meditates seriously, all the muscles
of his face appear stretched, nay sometimes
convuls’d. Nor does the brain,
the medulla of which is the source of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the nerves, suffer alone, but they themselves
are hurt; and <span class="smcap">Plato</span> has admirably
shewn, in the masculine style
in which he so greatly excell’d, how
much the exercise of the mind prejudices
the body. “Quando anima,
inquit, corpore admodum potentior
est, exultatque in eo atque effertur,
totum ipsum intrinsecus quatiens
languoribus implet. Quando etiam
ad dicendum, investigandumque, collectis
in unum viribus, vehementer
incumbit, liquefacit prorsus corpus,
&amp; labefactat; denique cum ad dicendum,
differendumque privatim
&amp; publice ambitiosa quadam concertatione
contendit, inflammat corpus
atque resolvit. Tam arcta enim
lege consortii, sic <span class="smcap">Ramazzini</span>, fœderantur
anima &amp; corpus ut omnia
tam bona quam mala unius in alterum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
vicissim corrivent, ac veluti, ex
corporis nimia exercitatione, anima
ad mentis functiones languescit, ac
torpet, sic ob nimiam animæ contentionem,

“As the mind, says he,
is far more powerful than the body,
and exults and is elate therein, it
affects it inwardly, and fills it entirely
with languor; and when, by
gathering together its strength, it
applies earnestly to learning and to
the investigating of things, it quite
dissolves and unhinges the body:
finally, when with an ambitious
emulation it exerts itself to speak
and harangue both in private and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
public, it inflames the body and relaxes
it. For, as <span class="smcap">Ramazzini</span> observes,
the soul and body are united
by so firm a league, that all the
advantages and disadvantages of the
one must affect the other; and as
the soul is rendered languid in the
mental functions, and become stupified
in the same manner by the too
great application of the mind to the
study of wisdom, the body must
unavoidably pine away, the animal
spirits being consum’d, which are
the only instruments of rightly performing
both material and spiritual
operations<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.” These are indeed
observations highly just. For he who is
not ignorant what a multitude of nerves
there are in the animal system, who
is sensible that there is no function<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
that can be performed without them,
will easily apprehend that by the fatigue
of the medulla a languor may be
brought upon all the nerves, so that
the several functions may be weakened,
and the strength of the body may,
without its being exercised, be totally
exhausted.</p>

<p>It is universally known that there are
books compos’d without any strength
of genius, which appear quite insipid
and unaffecting to the reader, and
only tire the eyes; but those that are
compos’d with an exquisite force of
ideas, and with an exact connexion
of thought, elevate the soul, and fatigue
it with the very pleasure, which,
the more compleat, lasting, and frequent
it is, breaks the man the more<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malebranche</span> was seized with
dreadful palpitations in reading <span class="smcap">Descartes’s</span>
Man; and there is still living
at Paris a professor of rhetoric, who
fainted away whilst he was perusing
some of the sublime passages of <span class="smcap">Homer</span><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>The head itself, and the nerves, and
the stomach which is fuller of nerves
than any other part, first suffer for the
errors of the mind.</p>

<p>An eminent person, who had impair’d
his health by too intense an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
application to study, was immediately
seiz’d by a terrible vertigo, if he happen’d
to listen attentively to a person
telling a story. He likewise complained,
that nothing could give him greater
uneasiness than his attempting to recall
the memory of any thing, for then he
was put to the greatest pain imaginable,
and sometimes seiz’d with a fainting
fit, attended with a sense of extreme
lassitude. Nor could he desist from
his effort after he had once begun it,
though he labour’d ever so much for
that purpose; but was under a necessity
of proceeding as he had begun,
till he fainted away<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. The illustrious
<span class="smcap">Viridet</span>, formerly my fellow-citizen,
knew a woman who, whenever
she us’d any application of mind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
was seiz’d with a severe fit of the colic<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
And a late author speaks of
a man who never either thought intensely,
or experienc’d any lively sensation,
or was put in a passion, but his
whole arm immediately swell’d up<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
Both of which cases may be explained
by the defect of the nerves alone, and
the action of the mind upon the nerves.</p>

<p>Daily observation proves the force
of the mind’s action upon the stomach;
and this every man has an opportunity
of experiencing in himself; for the
more intensely any man thinks, and
the more strongly he exerts the reflecting
powers of his mind, the more
slowly and with the greater difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
<i>cæteris paribus</i>, does he digest what
he eats; and, on the other hand, the
freer a man’s mind is from reflexion,
the more readily and the better he
digests. It is observable that fools always
eat and drink a great deal, and
yet digest perfectly well, even though
they lead a sedentary life, and do not
surpass others either in the bulk or
strength of their bodies: whilst men
of genius and abilities, though they
have strong muscles, and take exercise
sufficient, are obnoxious to crudities in
the stomach and slowness of concoction
<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>, who resided
a long time in a city renown’d for
learning, has observ’d that studies excite
a disagreeable sensation at the upper
orifice of the stomach; and that,
if this be neglected by the studious,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
madness ensues<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. My illustrious
friend <span class="smcap">Pome</span> knew a man of learning,
who had made his stomach so infirm
by intense application, that immediately
after eating he vomited<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. I myself
have seen some, who, when their
minds were wearied out with constant
study, being taken ill, at first lost all
appetite, then were seiz’d with a weakness
of their whole bodies, and at last
with dreadful paroxysms, which began
with vomiting, and ended in convulsions
and a total privation of their
senses.</p>

<p>Soon, by an unavoidable fatality,
the disorder that had affected the body
recoils upon the mind; for the Author
of nature has ordain’d that most of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
operations of the latter should stand in
need of the assistance of the former;
which has given occasion to the following
just observation of <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> the
younger<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and long before him it
was observed by <span class="smcap">Democritus</span>, that
the mind is supported by what supports
the body. “Augescit mens cum adest
sanitas, adeoque huic ut prospiciant,
qui recte sentiant consentaneum est:
ubi vero corporis habitus dolet nec
mens ad virtutis meditationem est
alacris.” “The mind acquires new
vigour whilst the body is in health;
therefore all those who think justly
will take care of the latter: but,
when the body is in a painful state,
the mind is less alert in the meditation
of virtue<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.” Should it then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
seem surprising, if, when the tenor
of the brain and nerves is broken by
the efforts of the mind, the latter
should decline in its turn? First of
all it is depriv’d of its fortitude; distrust,
terror, and melancholy, seize
upon it; and he who would have
stood undaunted amidst a falling world
a few months before, is every moment
fill’d with terror and consternation, as
soon as his nerves are affected by a
hypochondriac disorder. Relentless
tyrants may have condemn’d to death
philosophers whom they hated; but it
never was in their power to subject
them to the dread of death, which
they had long shaken off. O how
much more cruel would they have
been, if they had granted them their
lives, and had it in their power to
torment their minds with hypochondriacal
terrors!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>Thus render’d unequal to the task
of study, the learned are at last under
a necessity of quitting their belov’d
pursuits; for, as the strength of their
nerves diminishes, their attention fails,
the memory begins to lose its tenaciousness,
the ideas are obscur’d, and an
uneasy sensation of heat over the
whole head, a dreadful palpitation,
the most extraordinary weakness, and
a groundless fear of approaching death,
oblige them to discontinue their application.
Their strength being at last
repair’d by rest, nourishing aliments,
and exercise, they renew their assiduity
in study, but are soon oblig’d to quit
their books as before. Thus the whole
day is lost; and when evening approaches
and they retire to bed, their
weakness and anxiety make them pass
their nights most dismally, whilst
the great mobility of their nerves prevents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
their sleeping, and sometimes increases
to such a degree as totally to
deprive them of the power of thinking.
I know a young man, upon
whom an intense application to study
had this extraordinary effect, that, if
he read even a few pages, he was torn
with convulsions of the muscles of
the head and face, which assum’d
the appearance of ropes stretch’d very
tight.</p>

<p>Nor does too intense an application
produce only slight and transient convulsions
of the muscles; it likewise
renews and generates the most dreadful
nervous disorders. <span class="smcap">Galen</span><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
mentions a grammarian, who was
seized with a fit of the epilepsy, whenever
he meditated profoundly, or taught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
with vehemence. I myself have seen
instances of it. And the illustrious
<span class="smcap">Van Swieten</span> laments the case of
youths of the brightest hopes, who
have been seiz’d with a dreadful and
incurable epilepsy, upon being compell’d
by severe masters to apply to
their studies with scarce any intervals
of relaxation. <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> makes
mention of a young man, who, as
often as he weary’d out his memory
and his genius by attentive study, was
seiz’d with a momentary epilepsy, a
palpitation of the heart, and a trance;
but when he remitted of his assiduity,
was always tolerably well. This the
celebrated <span class="smcap">Petrarch</span> likewise unhappily
experienc’d, being seiz’d with an
epilepsy through his great application to
study, to which he was immoderately
attach’d. In a public promotion, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of the candidates for literary honour,
after having pursu’d his studies with
the moil arduous application both day
and night, through a too great attention
to his oration, that he might be able
to say it accurately by heart, was suddenly
seiz’d with a catalepsy and fell
down<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>The labour of the mind not only
produces nervous disorders, but, by
means of the nerves, gives rise to other
complaints. An eminent mathematician,
who was troubled with an hereditary
gout, and had always liv’d
soberly and chastely, hasten’d a paroxysm
by applying a long time to the
solution of a difficult problem<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.
And the case of the chevalier <span class="smcap">de Pernay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></span>
is very extraordinary. After four
months of the closest study imaginable,
and without any previous disorder, his
beard fell first, then his eye-lashes,
then his eye-brows, then the hair of
his head, and finally all the hairs of
his body<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Did this proceed from
the great relaxation of the roots, from
which the hairs grow; or from the
want of nutrition? Certain it is, that
an intense application of mind relaxes
the whole corporeal frame, and prevents
all nutrition for two reasons; for
this is the effect of thought, not upon
all, but upon most constitutions, that it
accelerates the pulse, and produces a
fever, which, by dissolving the nourishing
jelly of the fluids, occasions
paleness, leanness, consumption, and
a sort of wasting of the nerves; on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
other hand, the cessation of the action
of the nerves, is capable of producing
it. Nor does it less cease in
the whole body, whilst it is obstructed
by application of mind, than when it
is stopped by a swelling or a ligature
in any part. We should not be too
inquisitive in prying into causes; and
many circumstances relating to nervous
disorders will for ever remain unknown:
but if any one should be curious to
know how the too great tension of
the nerves is hurtful, I will briefly
give him my sense of the matter.
The body is exhausted by too great
an evacuation; hence arises weakness,
an extraordinary tenuity of the humours,
and, what it is generally productive
of, a diseased mobility. Suppose
the blood were to run copiously
from a wound, or the gastric fluids<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
were to be pour’d forth by the anus,
or the breasts suck’d too long, or a
greater discharge of saliva made by
spitting, or the wretched body were
to be troubled with a long diabetes,
or in short, any other evacuations were
too much increased, the strength would
decline, and the health be lost; but
whilst the nerves act, their fluid runs
out of the body, and carries off the
strength with it; nor is there any thing
in the body either more labour’d,
more necessary in many animal functions,
or more intimately connected
with strength. In studious men, therefore,
a perpetual dissipation of the
nervous fluid springs from the incessant
action of the nerves, attended with
weakness, and an extraordinary mobility,
from whence all the above-mention’d
diseases easily take rise; these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
are very dreadful, but diseases still more
dreadful remain to be describ’d.</p>

<p>It is not easy for the mind not to
throw out at will such motions as it
has powerfully conceiv’d; and this is
a second cause of the diseases of studious
men, from whence spring so
many errors and wanderings of the
mind, to be chang’d for death only,
so many phrenzies and deliriums: for
whilst ideas no longer answer to their
external objects, but to the internal
disposition of the brain, the latter being
agitated by its own motion, either
entirely, or in part, is unable
to receive new vibrations, to be transmitted,
all, or some, by the senses;
whereas those that are spontaneous
cannot be check’d.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>The brain of <span class="smcap">Blaise Paschal</span> was
so vitiated by passing his life in the laborious
exercises of study, thought, and
imagination, that certain fibres, agitated
by incessant motion, made him
perpetually feel a sensation, which
seem’d to be excited by a globe of
fire being plac’d on one side of him;
and his reason being overpower’d by
the disorder of his nerves, he could
scarce banish the idea of the fiery
globe being actually present. <span class="smcap">Spinello</span>
painted the devils thrown from
Heaven by the Almighty, and gave so
fierce a countenance to Lucifer, that
he was struck with horror himself;
and during the remainder of his life,
his imagination was continually haunted
with the figure of that demon, upbraiding
him with having made so
shocking a portrait of him. There are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
many others, whom the force of genius
too much rous’d, has for ever
hurried beyond the boundaries of truth.
<span class="smcap">Gaspar Barlæus</span>, who was at once
an orator, a poet, and a physician,
was not ignorant of this danger, concerning
which he admonish’d his friend
<span class="smcap">Constantius Huygens</span><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; but being
blind with regard to himself, he
by immoderate studies so broke the
force of his sensorium, that he thought
his body was made of butter, and carefully
shun’d the fire, lest it should
melt him, till being at last tir’d of his
excruciating fears, he leapt into a well.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
I must still grieve for a friend of a penetrating
genius, an excellent understanding,
of strict morals, and one that
seem’d born for a better fate; who being
animated with too great a love of
learning, and in particular of the medical
science, by reading night and
day, observing, making experiments,
and meditating, at first became sleepless;
then began to talk, sometimes
incoherently, and sometimes rationally;
at last run mad, and having scarcely
escap’d with life, never recover’d his
reason. I have known many others,
who by study alone were first rendered
phrantic, or crazy, and at length became
idiots. I love, esteem, and honour
an illustrious man, and a man
of extraordinary abilities, who being
twelve hours intent upon settling a
difficult memorial, after having finish’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
his work, became delirious till a soft
sleep quieted the state of his nerves.
Observers give us accounts of many
similar cases, and I was inform’d by
a witness who may be confided in, that
<span class="smcap">Peter Jurieu</span> was formerly famous
for his talent at disputing, by his labours
in writing books of controversy,
and expounding the apocalypse, so disorder’d
his brain, that though he
thought like a man of sense in other
respects, he was firmly persuaded that
the seven fits of the cholic, with which
he was tormented, had been occasion’d
by a constant fight between seven
horsemen that were shut up in his
bowels. There have been many instances
of persons, who thought themselves
metamorphos’d into lanterns,
and who complain’d of having lost
their thighs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>But those are affected in the most
dangerous manner, who dwell too
long upon one and the same thought;
for thus one part of the sensorium being
longer stretch’d than the rest,
without being ever reliev’d by the
others in their turn, is the sooner
broke; for as the body suffers more
if one or but a few muscles alone act,
so the brain is the less fatigued when
various parts act successively; the part
which discontinues recovers its strength,
whilst the others are at work; and
that is durable which does not want
alternate rest.</p>

<p>Many years ago I knew a woman,
who appear’d to have very good sense
for five and twenty years; but having,
unhappily for her, embrac’d the sect
of the Herrenhutters, she became entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
inflam’d by the love of our
blessed Saviour, and of him alone;
and she dwelling entirely upon this
idea both day and night, it so broke
the tone of her brain, that in a few
months time she became an idiot; but
still she was so mindful of her Lamb,
that visiting her every day for half a
year together, and frequently addressing
my discourse to her, I could never
hear any other words from her than
<i>my sweet Lamb</i>; and this she utter’d
every half hour, with downcast eyes,
and was the only word she spoke for
a year and a half; which time being
elapsed, she pin’d away and died. And
to pass by other examples, there was
not long ago in this academy, a young
man of bright hopes, who being too
earnestly solicitous about squaring the
circle, died mad in the Paris hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>The third cause of the disorders of
the brain, is, that law to which the
human machine is subjected; that a
new quantity of blood should be added
to the part that acts. The illustrious
<span class="smcap">Morgagni</span> knew a man of learning
at Boulogne, who whenever he gave
his mind to abstract meditations in
the morning, before he rose, was sure
to bleed at the nose for a short time
after<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Therefore as often as the
brain increases its action, it is moisten’d
with an additional quantity of blood,
which, giving a new tension and a
quicker motion to the vessels, brings
on both the sense of pain and heat already
mentioned, and many more grievous
symptoms; namely, according to
the different state of the brain, of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
blood, and external objects, it occasions
dilatations of the veins and arteries,
obstructions of the nerves, inflammations,
suppurations, scirrhous tumours,
ulcers, dropsies, and thence
head-achs, deliriums, drowsiness, convulsions,
lethargy, apoplexy, and continual
obstinate watchings, which cruelly
torment the studious, and afflict
them with new diseases; for what diseases,
what perturbations of the mind
do not protracted watchings give rise
to? The great <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span> was six
weeks without sleep, after profound
study and meditation; and at the same
time so indifferent to every thing, that
scarce any object whatever affected
him<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. And which of you, learned
auditors, has not found by experience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
that a slight and disturb’d sleep, a sleep
that scarce gives refreshment, generally
follows a day pass’d in study. A slight
irritation of the brain causes want of
sleep; from one more considerable arise
convulsions and drowsiness; from
the greatest of all a mortal apoplexy,
which disorder often puts an end to
the lives of learned men. The reason
is, that that part suffers which was
guilty of the excess, and whilst the
strength of the brain is relax’d by study,
and fresh blood is forc’d into it, it must
sooner or later be quite overwhelm’d,
especially at the time that some new
cause adds force to the blood that impells
it; thence it has frequently come
to pass, that learned divines in preaching,
and learned professors in delivering
their lectures, or disputing, as was
the case with the celebrated <span class="smcap">Curtius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></span>
at Leipsick, expir’d on their very chairs;
and <span class="smcap">Livy</span> the historian has preserv’d
to us the history of king <span class="smcap">Attalus</span>,
who died in the assembly at Thebes,
whilst he was animating the Bœotians
by an harangue to enter into an alliance
with the Romans.</p>

<p>I saw a reverend pastor, who on
Whitsun-sunday, after having preach’d
long and with vehemence, whilst he
was distributing the host to the people,
was first seiz’d with trembling, then
stammer’d, then was delirious, then
fell down in an apoplectic fit, and
continuing delirious ever after, though
in an advanc’d age, liv’d for some
months in a state of infancy. The
celebrated <span class="smcap">Morgagni</span> likewise mentions
a preaching monk, who was
seiz’d with a violent apoplexy before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
his congregation, and quickly died;
his vehemence of delivery conspiring
with a plethora to destroy him<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
A professor at Berne, deeply versed in
the oriental languages, a man in the
prime of life, but of indefatigable industry,
not long since sunk into a second
infancy, and a state of idiotism,
his brain being overflow’d by water,
which stagnated in it<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>We must not forget, in enumerating
the injuries suffered by the brain from
this overflowing of the blood, that the
disorder of the nerves which causes
the hypochondriac disposition, is increased;
their little tubes being dilated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
are constantly weaken’d, grow soft,
and make less resistance to impressions,
which is one of the chief causes of
the hypochondriac disorder.</p>

<p>Nor do the sufferings of studious
men end here, since from another law,
which holds equally in the animal
œconomy, a fourth cause of the disorders
of the learned springs from an
over violent labour of the mind; for
the animal fibre is indurated by being
used, the whole machine grows callous
as it grows old; the parts that are
exercised by labour become hardened
in workmen; the brain of studious
men contracts a callosity, so that becoming
unequal to the task of forming
ideas, they fall into a premature dotage:
thus the too great softness of an
infant’s brain, and the too great hardness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
of a brain occasioned by study, are
equally ill adapted to produce those
vibrations, without which the force
of thought is lost. Let the fibre be
moisten’d with water, or stiffened with
lime and sand, it in both cases becomes
equally incapable of performing
its function. At first the memory is
impair’d, as <span class="smcap">Galen</span> justly observes,
and then reason itself is disturb’d<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is there any necessity that the
mind should meditate great and sublime
objects, to impair the strength
of the nervous system; a too protracted
use of the eyes has often given
rise to innumerable nervous disorders;
concerning which, the testimony of
<span class="smcap">Gunzius</span> is of the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
authority<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. And every weak man must
know by experience, how much too
great a use of the eyes weakens the
head. Of this I have already given an
example, and have often found it by
experience; for when I contemplate
any object a considerable time, after
the fit of a fever, or any other disorder,
and before my health is quite
recovered, I am seiz’d with a vertigo,
a sickness in the stomach, and a disagreeable
listlessness of the whole body.</p>

<p>In order to vindicate literature from
the charge brought against it, you will
doubtless object, that many men of
profound learning, have liv’d to the
most advanc’d age, and retain’d their
powers both of mind and body unimpair’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
to the last. I have heard of
many, I have myself seen more; nor
can either you or I ever forget that
truly illustrious man, that man of universal
learning, who as he was worthy
of it, enjoy’d general love and veneration;
who was the ornament, honour,
and delight of this academy for
above fifty years, and whom we all
with equal wonder and satisfaction saw
enter upon his 90th year, without
either his reason, or his senses being
in the least impair’d. But all are not
equally happy, and there are few men
endued with such strength, both of
mind and body, as to undergo such
labours with impunity, if even those
can be said to undergo them with impunity,
who attain to that stage of
life, which they perhaps would have
greatly exceeded, had they liv’d in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
different manner. Some men are by
nature insatiable in drinking wine, others
are born cormorants of books,
and never glutted with the acquisition
of learning: nor should it be pass’d
over in silence, that almost all the
learned men, who are look’d upon
as its masters by the human species,
all liv’d to a great age; as <span class="smcap">Homer</span>,
<span class="smcap">Democritus</span>, <span class="smcap">Parmenides</span>, <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>,
<span class="smcap">Plato</span>, <span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>, Lord
<span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, <span class="smcap">Galilæo</span>, <span class="smcap">Harvey</span>, <span class="smcap">Wallis</span>,
<span class="smcap">Boyle</span>, <span class="smcap">Locke</span>, <span class="smcap">Leibnitz</span>, <span class="smcap">Newton</span>,
<span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>. Can it then justly
be inferred, that violent exercises of
the mind are not hurtful? Take care
how you draw so false a conclusion?
But, as I said awhile ago, some men
are born with happy constitutions for
meditation, and perhaps that excellent
constitution of the fibres, productive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
of longevity, is the same that produces
great geniuses;</p>

<p class="noindent">and consequently the great men, whom
I have just mention’d, owed their reputation
more to their extraordinary
genius, than to industry and application;
and prevented the ill effects of
their severer studies, by allowing themselves
intervals of leisure, by taking
proper exercise, and by the dissipation
both of business and amusement. Nor
did they lead the life of abstracted
students, a species of men little known
to the ancients, and who took their rise
first at the declension of literature, were
renew’d at its revival, and may be properly
compar’d to the Indian fakirs;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
for both bid farewell to the human
race, and both of their own accord,
and generally without any emolument
to society, emaciate and inflict austerities
upon themselves; the former by
the sun, by cold, by nails, by chains,
by whips; the latter by books, manuscripts,
coins, monuments, and almost
all by inaction, and the want of
bodily exercise. This is another, and
a most prolific source of the disorders
which afflict men addicted to study;
for the human machine was form’d
and intended for action by the supreme
artificer: therefore health is inseparable
from action, which will be easily
conceiv’d by whoever examines the
human body with attention.</p>

<p>It consists of containing and moving
vessels, contained and moved fluids: if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the fibres or vessels have a proper tone,
if the fluids have a proper consistence,
if the motions, by which they should
be continually agitated, are neither too
violent, nor deficient, we enjoy a good
state of health. But it should be
taken into consideration, that motion
is here the chief agent, for, that alone
being chang’d, the whole state of the
solids and fluids is chang’d likewise:
if it be increased, the solids grow
harder, and the fluids are compress’d;
if it be diminished, the fibre becomes
relaxed, the density of the blood is
lessened, for the whole body is form’d
of a chyle, which is softer and lighter
than any part of the body, either solid
or fluid, whose small particles a continual
motion unites and strongly compresses;
and if this motion should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
fail, the parts must prove deficient in
their due firmness.</p>

<p>But the heart is the source of all the
motions in the animal machine, the
principle which puts the whole mass
of fluids in motion, but is not alone
sufficient for that purpose; wherefore
nature has given it many helps, which
never discontinue or remit, but the
circulation becomes slower, and diseases
arise from the motion of the
fluids being retarded. The chief of
these helps is the muscular motion,
whose extraordinary force in quickening
the circulation, the most ignorant
surgeon every day displays to the eyes
of all spectators, by an easy experiment,
when upon opening a vein he
bids the patient move some cylindrical
instrument round about in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
hand, in order to accelerate the emission
of the blood: nay, every man may
easily perceive in himself, how much
the quickness of the pulse is increased
by the motion of the body; and these
are the effects of motion, it sharpens
the appetite, it strengthens the fibres,
keeps up a due temperature of the
fluids, promotes all the excretions, fortifies
the mind, and gives a pleasing
sensation to the whole nervous system;
whereas by too great sloth, the muscular
strength is first destroy’d for want
of practice; and from a neglect of
exercise there springs an impotence
of motion: the circulation which is
carried on only by the strength of the
heart and the vessels, and destitute of
external helps, first languishes in the
most minute vessels, and then in every
part of the body; the heat decreases,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
the humours stagnate, and contract a
vitious disposition; for some of them
lose part of their density, others part
of their tenuity, and they all become
glutinous, and of consequence unfit
for secretions; therefore what should
be secreted is retain’d, the body is
loaded with a mass of adventitious
humours, it is destroy’d by their acrimony,
the vigour of life is benumb’d,
the strength declines, the
blood is dissolved to water; hence arises
a dropsy, a disorder in a manner
epidemical to men of learning, by
which the brain is often affected. An
instance of this I lately saw, with
concern, in an eminent man, whose
case I discover’d too late, and who
not by literary pursuits, but other exercises
of the mind, and total inaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
of body, had broke a constitution
which once was robust<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>Those parts suffer the most, which
having but weak solids, they want external
helps more than any others; hence
those organs are most affected by inaction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
which, being contained in the
abdomen, perform the first digestion
of the aliments: the strength of the
stomach is diminish’d, the nature of
the gastric fluid is chang’d, the aliments
make a longer stay in it, and,
not being sufficiently subdu’d by the
animal force, they go through their
spontaneous changes which they would
have undergone out of the body. Most
vegetables retain their tartness, which,
by vellicating the nerves, occasions
pains and convulsions; acid eructations
arise, the cardia suffers pain, the throat
is parched, and the teeth blunted. On
the contrary, both flesh and eggs rot,
and fat aliments grow rank: hence
proceed putrid eructations, immoderate
thirst, and continual fluxes; digestion
is always difficult, troublesome, and
malignant; the aliments cease to afford<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
nourishment, nor do they any longer
repair, but irritate and weaken.</p>

<p>The exhaling vessels no longer pour
forth a dewy, mild, and saponaceous
lymph, but they throw out a thick
glue, which affects the sick with a
constant pain and sense of a heavy
weight, and of cold at the stomach,
and creates the utmost loathing. The
consequence is the same when the intestines,
being of the same structure
with the stomach, suffer the same injuries:
the action of respiration first
begins to fail, whose alternate compressions,
whilst it is accelerated by the
muscular motion, compress and strain
all the viscera of the abdomen; their
irritability is lost, the body is generally
costive; there is here likewise accumulated,
a troublesome phlegm, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
prolific mother of diseases. Thus it
once happen’d to the celebrated <span class="smcap">Justus
Lipsius</span>, professor of history at
Leyden, who being long ill, and under
the care of his illustrious colleague and
friend <span class="smcap">Heurnius</span>, found no relief till
he had voided a substance resembling
the intestines both in figure and colour;
it was a tough and viscid phlegm,
gradually collected in the whole tube
of the intestines, through a sedentary
life wasted by study; and this phlegm,
turning to putrefaction, made a jakes
of the whole body. The fomes of
the disease being thus purg’d off, he
was restor’d to health<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p>The collected excrements compress
with their bulk the neighbouring parts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
irritate the intestines by their corruption,
and by absorbing the putrid matter
infect the whole mass of blood.
From all these causes put together
arise those excruciating pains in the
bowels which often torment the studious,
and are with difficulty cur’d, as
they are perpetually renew’d by errors
in diet<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Hence that troublesome
flatulency, so hurtful to sedentary men,
which torments the learned a thousand
different ways, and often passes for
other disorders.</p>

<p>The intestines are not only affected,
but the functions of the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
parts are disturb’d, as well from the
violence of the compression as from
their own diseases; the pancreatic juice
grows vapid and stale, the functions
of the spleen are vitiated, the repositories
of the bile are much disturb’d;
by its stagnation it loads the liver,
forms obstructions in it, thickens and
grows hard itself, and flows slowly to
the intestines; whence their disorders,
especially those of the jejunum, and
vices of the chyle, increase; being scarce
able to pass through the narrow neck of
the cystic duct, it often concretes into
a stone, and occasions those severe colics
with which the celebrated <span class="smcap">Ignatius</span>,
founder of the Jesuits, was
formerly afflicted, and with which the
learned are often tormented<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. If at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
length by stagnating it putrifies, it
then erodes, ulcerates, inflames, and
assumes the appearance of all the innumerable
disorders of the liver, and
produces inconceivable anxieties. These
are likewise caus’d, though with less
danger, by that cruel disease call’d the
hypochondriac; the first species of
which, mention’d above, and call’d
the nervous, is occasion’d by excessive
labour of the mind; the other, I mean
the abdominal species, arises from a
disturb’d circulation in the abdomen.
With both these disorders the learned
are afflicted, and therefore seldom or
never live free from this evil; and,
whilst one of these adds force to another,
they are seldom entirely cur’d
of them<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>Considering they occur so frequently,
it is hardly necessary to give examples;
but if I were to cite examples,
the first that would occur to my
mind would be that of the illustrious
<span class="smcap">Swammerdam</span>, that sagacious inquirer
into nature, who was so full
of atrabilary humours, that he scarce
vouchsafed to answer those who spoke
to him, but look’d upon them with
an unalter’d countenance; and, when
he took his seat as professor, sat with
a face of astonishment, and made no
answer to the objections of his opponents.
Finally, having, before his
death, wasted away with a phrantic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
melancholy, he burn’d all the manuscripts
he had by him in a fit of madness:
being reduced in appearance to
a skeleton and the mere figure of a
man<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, he died at length of a consumption.</p>

<p>It has indeed been observ’d, that
this species of melancholy in some
measure promotes learning, by increasing
the penetration; for, whilst
melancholy men are intent upon one
idea only, the mind contemplates this
object alone, and considers it on every
side; nor is it distracted by other pursuits.
But who ever proceeded to this
pitch of madness, as to desire to purchase
an increase of discernment at such
a price? Of what advantage is science<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
without health? He knows too much,
who is render’d unhappy by his knowledge.</p>

<p>It cannot indeed be denied, that
there are men whom nature has endow’d
with a Milonian stomach, and
intestines of iron, who can bear with
impunity the labour of the mind, bodily
inaction, and excesses of gluttony.
But are they therefore more happy? By
no means; for then the vessels are
overwhelm’d by the load of humours,
the cellular membrane swells with fat,
the viscera are press’d on every side,
the whole habit grows turgid, they
become heavy and indolent, the slightest
motion puts them quite out of
breath, and they sweat all over; at
last they die before their time, either
of apoplexy, a suffocating catarrh, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
other diseases occasion’d by plethora:
and it has been justly observ’d, that
too strong a stomach has often prov’d
fatal to the learned<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>There is no part of the body which
is not at last affected by inaction; for
the blood being vitiated, all the parts,
which it washes, catch the infection
sooner or later; the lungs are overwhelm’d
with a mucous substance, this
gives rise to a cough, a shortness of breath,
an asthma, an imposthume. This the
illustrious <span class="smcap">Triglandus</span> unhappily experienc’d,
who, having contracted a
bad habit of body by a studious and
sedentary life, from which <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>
himself dissuaded him, wasted
away with an imposthume and died,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
after having suffer’d the most excruciating
torments<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. By the mucous
matter being harden’d the lungs of
<span class="smcap">Swammerdam</span> were turn’d into a
quarry, and he spit up small stones
a long time before his death.</p>

<p>That the stone, and other severer
disorders of the bladder, are the fruits
of too assiduous an application to learning,
is prov’d by the sad experience of
<span class="smcap">Heurnius</span>, <span class="smcap">Casaubon</span>, <span class="smcap">Beverovicius</span>,
<span class="smcap">Sydenham</span>, and many others,
amongst whom may be reckon’d the
illustrious exile of Geneva, to whom
Britain now boasts of having afforded
an asylum<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Whilst all the excretions are disturb’d,
the chief of them all, namely
cuticular perspiration, is not free from
disease. As perspiration is greatly promoted
by muscular motion, which
both prepares humours for secretion,
and gives strength to the exhaling
vessels; so is it greatly interrupted by
the want of that motion; the humour
that ought to be excreted is retain’d,
and pollutes the whole mass of the
fluids, and gives rise to rheumatic or
catarrhous disorders and a troublesome
phlegm. Of this <span class="smcap">Horace</span> complained
long since, and with this complaint
almost all men of learning are afflicted;
for they can scarce read or write for
any time, but they are immediately
troubled with a slight running of the
nose, or seiz’d with a cough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>From the same source are derived
those irregular fevers, which often occur
without any visible cause, whilst
the unperspirable humours, which have
been generated by the defect of the
stomach, and the want of motion, are
unable to pass the cutaneous vessels.</p>

<p>Perpetual rest is alone able to torture
those nerves, which have been weakened
by the labours of the mind; and
it often quite destroys them, even in
those who equally give themselves up
to indolence both mental and corporeal.
For the nervous system is the
last work of the human machine, and
if any function fails, the nerves are
immediately affected; so that often
from their defect, whenever it appears,
there results a well-grounded suspicion
of a disease in the stomach, or in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
other part. They are therefore vitiated
in the learned for two reasons; for,
being plac’d between the mind and
body, they are punish’d though innocent,
let which of the two be in
fault; nor do they however go unrevenged;
for the injuries they suffer
on one part they carry over to t’other,
and thus, by a vicious circle, the mind
hurts the body, and the body impairs
the mind, and they with one accord
injure and weaken the nerves.</p>

<p>The seminal fluid, which has been
thought by some great men not to be
very different from the nervous liquor,
is likewise depriv’d of its force; and
upon this principle, and from an accurate
consideration of what each part
in a father contributes to the formation
of a son, it perhaps is not badly accounted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
for, why strong and illustrious
sons are seldom the offspring of illustrious
men: for the <i>punctum saliens</i>
is contaminated at the first moment
of life, whence it receives an injury
which is not afterwards to be repair’d
by any art; and whilst the mind of
the father was entirely given up to
meditation, and his corporeal functions
totally neglected, the vivifying liquor
was perhaps defrauded of that part of
elaboration which it should have had
from the brain, so as to give a proper
tone to the brain of the embryo.</p>

<p>From that general laxity of the
fibres, which is demonstrated to the
senses themselves by the softness of the
muscles, by the force of the artery,
and by that laxity of the gums which
throws out sound teeth without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
pain; from that general laxity, I say,
arises that weakness which oppresses
so many learned men, and which I
lately lamented to see, whilst, as a
friend and physician, I sat by our
beloved <span class="smcap">Alphonsus</span><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, to whom
the wishes of the public had promis’d
the age of <span class="smcap">Nestor</span>; and all the hopes
I had of his recovering his health were
immediately banish’d, by a weakness
greater than any I remember ever to
have seen, and which the Herculean
labours of his mind had brought upon
a thin body. How great and irrepairable
a loss was then sustain’d by religion,
virtue, the church, the city, his
unfortunate family, and the youth of
this academy! What a man, what a
colleague, what a friend have we lost,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
illustrious professors! one who, as <span class="smcap">Euphrates</span>
of old, was remarkable for
the greatest sanctity of manners, for
the utmost care in the discharge of all
the duties incumbent upon him, which
were many in number; one whose
complaisance was equal, who was entirely
free from austerity, whose presence
excited reverence, and not dread,
for he was severe upon vices, not upon
men; whose learning was extensive,
whose discourse was copious,
various, and, above all, pleasing, and
yet not without a Platonic sublimity;
one, in short, who was capable of persuading
and working upon such as
were most averse to his documents:
having liv’d in the utmost veneration,
he left behind him the highest regret
for his loss. But to return to our subject
from this sad digression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Thus have I treated of the two first
causes of the diseases of the learned;
others remain still to be spoken of;
and the first that occurs, whilst I am
upon the subject of inaction, is the
very posture of constant sitting, with
the body stooping, and the legs bent;
for this both hurts the lower extremities,
and, by obstructing the viscera
of the abdomen, soon occasions all sorts
of disorders arising from indigestion:
and those learned doctors prudently
consult their health, who indulge
their meditations, not indeed standing,
for that posture is not without
its inconveniences, but walking. And
this is one of the bad effects of sitting,
that it greatly obstructs the passage of
the blood in the abdominal veins,
which makes it stagnate at the anus,
where it meets with less resistance, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
causes those shocking piles that torment
so many literati, and, though praised
by some, certainly do much more harm
than good.</p>

<p>Nocturnal lucubrations, which are
hurtful upon many accounts, must have
their place amongst the causes of disorders;
for whilst a great part of the
night is spent in study, sufficient time
is not allow’d for sleep; nor does a
gentle slumber succeed meditation; a
circumstance which I have already lamented:
for the oscillations of the
fibres of the brain still continue, and
that full ease of the internal senses is
wanting which alone is capable of repairing
our lost strength. They likewise
pitch upon an unreasonable time
for sleep; for nature has assigned the
first approach of night as the proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
time for beginning to repose; the night
invites to sleep as well as the unwholesome
air, and to this end its darkness
and silence contribute: besides,
the nocturnal air is cold and moist,
and, when the sun retires, most animals
feel their strength diminish’d,
and night forces some of them to sleep
even against their inclinations, as it
does many plants.</p>

<p>The night air is so unfavourable
to study, that the celebrated <span class="smcap">Van
Swieten</span> knew a gouty man, in
whom the slightest application of
mind, and even the reading of a
letter, after sun-set, occasion’d a fit
of the gout. Nor should we forget
that study forces the blood into the
brain, and that nothing can be more
dangerous than to study in bed; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
both sleep, and the posture of the body
in sleep, increases the quantity of blood
in the skull.</p>

<p>Therefore nocturnal studies produce
all those disorders which the want of
rest gives rise to; the organs of sense
are principally affected; their strength
is exhausted, the fibres are either worn
or agitated by violent motions; hence
arise an incoherent series of thoughts,
a luxuriant imagination, deliriums,
dreadful head-achs, and, finally, a total
privation of sleep, scarce to be cur’d
by remedies, and which often occasions
fatal disorders.</p>

<p>The injuries of watching are increased
by the ill effects of candles,
which infect the air by their gross vapour,
so pernicious to the lungs, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
eyes, and the nerves. It is, therefore,
the highest advantage imaginable to go
to bed betimes, and rise early in the
morning. <i>Aurora musis amica</i>: Aurora
favours the muses.</p>

<p>The close air, which they always
use, is hurtful; but I shall speak of
the air hereafter. Nor should their
dirtiness be forgotten, as some learned
men, entirely neglecting the care of
their bodies, and not at all sollicitous
about cleanliness, disgust others, and
bring upon themselves those disorders
which proceed from obstructed perspiration:
for how can that skin perspire,
whose pores are stopped up with dirt.
Most of them are extremely faulty
with respect to their teeth, which,
being filled with putrid filth, and exhaling
a most nauseous stench, first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
infect all the adjacent parts, and the
very saliva of the sick person; soon
after cause violent pains, and at last,
falling before the time, leave the stomach
destitute of the powerful aid of
mastication.</p>

<p>Akin to dirtiness is the pernicious
custom of some, who, deaf to the calls
of nature, defer going to stool, and
suppress their urine a long time, to
avoid interrupting their studies; not reflecting
that many dreadful disorders
spring from this source.</p>

<p>For by too long a delay the secreted
humours become too putrid, are attenuated,
irritate the intestines or the
bladder, vitiate the mucous matter,
and sometimes occasion grievous disorders
of the particular organ; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
putrid matter being absorb’d by the
vessels with which all the cavities of
the body abound, pollutes the blood;
and, which is still worse, the nerves
become disused to obey the stimulus;
nay, they sometimes, by too much
tension, begin to grow paralytic; so
that the expulsive force, for the voiding
of excrements or urine, almost
entirely ceases, and should every day
be renew’d by art. Whilst the illustrious
<span class="smcap">Tycho Brahe</span>, riding in the
same chariot with the emperor, suppress’d
his urine, he pay’d for his ill-tim’d
modesty by death; and I even
now have under my care a man of
learning, who by a long suppression of
his urine became unable to contain it;
nor can he void it when he thinks
proper, but it runs from him night
and day by drops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>Retirement from all human society
is likewise hurtful to them; for man,
whom nature made for man, she intended
also should be benefited by society.</p>

<p>But nothing renders study and application
more pernicious than the sadness
that accompanies them: study is
capable of clouding the temper of the
happiest man with melancholy: if real
and external causes of grief are added
to this, the mind, overwhelm’d with
so many strokes, at last sinks under
them, and in its own ruin involves
that of the body. Anxious cares are
likewise hurtful; so that I can hardly
conceive how great men, whom the
difficulty of their undertakings kept in
unremitting meditation, and whom
the uncertainty of events fill’d with
continual anxiety, could go through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
with such great undertakings. Nature
endow’d <span class="smcap">Cæsar</span>, <span class="smcap">Mahomet</span>, <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>,
<span class="smcap">Paoli</span>, and some few more,
with faculties which she refused other
mortals, and which, notwithstanding,
would scarce have enabled them to
perform such great exploits without
the assistance of sobriety and incessant
action.</p>

<p>We should not, however, imagine,
that the learned alone destroy their
health by mental labour; it is of no
consequence what the object is that
engages the mind, if it applies a considerable
time and with earnestness, it
wastes both its own strength and that
of the body. Kings, senators, ministers,
ambassadors, and all those concern’d in
the administration of public affairs, are
subject to the same unhappy fate which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the learned deplore, if they labour
with equal assiduity in transacting public
affairs, as the learned in perusing
books. But it is their happiness, that,
in the various business and dissipation
of their places, they are oblig’d often
to quit their closets, and even against
their wills are, by a salutary necessity,
compell’d to take frequent exercise:
the chief use of this is, that it admirably
prepares the blood for the
generation of fresh animal spirits, and
in the same time it brings a greater
quantity of blood to the secerning organs,
and so restores what thought
had exhausted, and frames new instruments
for the thinking mind. But
nothing can force the studious from
their books, and they are quite enervated
by inaction: to palliate which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
you will perhaps bring some examples
of men who have liv’d to a
great age, though they used but little
or no action. There are but few men;
but you will, I doubt not, bring many
women. Take notice, however, that,
though they had not much muscular
motion, they had many other helps,
by which nature promotes the circulation
of the blood, <i>viz.</i> an agreeable
stirring of the passions, which excites,
and does not destroy; a constant chearfulness
and eternal loquacity, and other
assistances of a similar nature: they
likewise use but little food. The case
is quite different with the learned:
they do not live with the same sobriety;
and therefore it is no wonder that they
enjoy their health worse than any other
class of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Thus have I laid before you the
chief causes, from which the diseases
incident to the studious take rise; and
I should never make an end, were I
to enumerate the inferior causes, which
professors have a bad custom of assigning
from their own invention: I shall
therefore pass by all the secondary
causes. But there are men, truly
learned, illustrious votaries of the
muses, who, besides the disorders that
spring from too assiduous an application
of mind, experience others, owing to
the nature of the object that engages
them. Anatomists often contract malignant
fevers by breathing putrid air,
and other diseases from the corruption
of the bile, from the matter in which
their hands are constantly immersed,
a slight excoriation arising, or an inconsiderable
wound, which sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
end in their deaths. Chemical experiments
are attended with danger, and
an acid smoke, of a very penetrating
nature, would have kill’d the great
<span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>, if there had not been
at hand an alcaline spirit, which overcame
the acid and expanded the compressed
lungs. Botanists have been often
hurt by the plants for which they have
so strong a passion. These, and the like,
rather relate to the disorders of artificers,
(excuse the expression); but this discourse
turns upon the disorders which
study brings upon some of the organs.</p>

<p>The first that offer are the eyes,
which constant attention so fatigues,
that I have often seen doctors who had
not attain’d to their thirtieth year, and
yet could hardly bear the light, especially
candle-light; and were scarce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
able to read a few pages without their
eyes being suffused with tears, then
growing dim, and at last quite incapable
to distinguish any object. But
the eyes are much sooner and much
more easily affected by reading at night;
for there is not a man living who has
not experienc’d, at least once in his
life, how much they suffer by the
motion of light and the irritation of
smoke.</p>

<p>Orators have disorders peculiar to
themselves, which are of a very grievous
nature: for however reading aloud
may be of service to the lungs, vehement
declamation is hurtful: and how
often do preachers or lawyers pass
whole days and nights in their studies,
when the lungs, unequal to the efforts
of speaking, are severely injur’d. How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
much more happy are those pastors of
the church, who cultivate learning,
but are kept from their studies by
other avocations, being in this respect
equally privileg’d with the physicians,
whom the health of their fellow-creatures
does not suffer to impair their
own health by study. Happy likewise
are all those whom the nature
of their business calls off from study;
for though they are not thereby exempted
from the labours of the mind,
the change of their employments is
however a great consolation to them.
But unhappy are those preachers, who,
being exempt from other ecclesiastical
functions, live only to study, and
compose eloquent discourses; unhappy
those lawyers, who are entirely taken
up with managing and pleading causes;
for their health is insensibly impaired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
by the life they lead, their throat,
wind-pipe, and lungs, are irritated,
heated, and inflamed; hence proceed
catarrhs, hoarseness, a broken voice,
spitting of blood, a cough, a fever,
great weakness, and at last a consumption;
and, whilst they give light to
others, they are extinguished like the
snuff of a candle, unless they take care
of themselves. This is what <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>
did, who, being told that he was beginning
to be consumptive, avoided
pleading for two years, by the advice
of his physicians; in which time he
recovered his strength and health,
which had been greatly impaired<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>These, worthy auditors, are most
of the disorders that are occasioned by
too great an attachment to study, or
a continued application of the mind to
any object whatever: nor are we to
imagine that all undergo the same
sufferings; much variety is here occasioned
by the various constitutions of
men, by their different ages, and the
diversity of their external circumstances.
There are few or no bodies but what
have some weak parts, which suffer
the first attacks of every disorder. He
whose stomach is naturally weak, or
who has rendered it so by living in a
manner not suited to his constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
will first complain of pains in the ventricle,
whilst the nerves, which he received
strong in a weak body, are still
in a good state. On the other hand,
he who is troubled with weak nerves,
but has a good stomach, will long
suffer all sorts of nervous disorders,
the digestion remaining unhurt.</p>

<p>He in whom the muscular or cellular
fibres are relaxed, will complain of
lassitude, drowsiness, weakness, swellings,
his head and stomach remaining
unhurt. Another will suffer all the
disorders incident to the lungs, who
received them from nature not indued
with a proper degree of strength. In
these the vascular system of the head
is weak, they are troubled with incessant
head-achs, or bleeding at the
nose, to which other studious youths<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
are obnoxious, their intense application
to study forcing the blood upwards.
Finally, every man, according
to the part affected with weakness,
is liable to complain of some
disorders more than others.</p>

<p>Even strength itself has its disadvantages;
for whilst robust and vigorous
young men devote themselves
to study with unbridled ardour, the
power of the soul, being rous’d and
strongly stimulating the whole system,
so increases the action of the solids,
that there arise diseases occasion’d by
too violent a motion, such as inflammations
and malignant fevers; and
when these disorders are once begun,
they return for some years, till the
strength being entirely broken, chronical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
disorders succeed, according to
the common fate of mankind.</p>

<p>A great deal depends upon the age,
with regard to which we should not
be so indiscreet as to bear too hard
upon youth, nor exact from them
over great tasks; for nothing so totally
exhausts and destroys the strength.
I have often found boys of a penetrating
genius, tinctured with learning
beyond what could be expected from
their years, and always with some
concern, as I saw how it would end;
because our youthful days should be
consecrated to exercise, and to acquiring
strength by its means, and not
to severe study, which obstructs both
vigour and growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>There have been examples of boys,
who before they had pass’d their sixth
year, appear’d by their sudden growth
to be men: the last example of this
sort, we meet with in the memoirs
of the French academy: but listen to
the sequel: the understanding continued
that of a child in a well set body,
and, the strength being so soon exhausted,
could scarce support a life of
twelve years. Whilst the powers of
the mind, or in other words, the
strength of the brain surpass the age,
nature, which is unequal to many
tasks, forgets the body; the whole
machine is overwhelm’d with languor,
the fibres want strength, and severe
disorders bring on an untimely death.
<span class="smcap">John Philip Barathier</span> lately afforded
us an illustrious and well known
example of the truth of this observation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
You all lament another <span class="smcap">Philip</span>,
whom you knew, and whom
I regret not having known more intimately,
who being from his early
infancy endowed with a penetrating
genius, and addicted to study at that
time of life, which nature intended
should be dedicated to strengthening
the body, was attack’d by the severest
disorders, and could recover his health
only by the most abstemious diet, and
by totally relinquishing his studies:
but soon, unmindful of his weakness,
he by an untimely death paid for his
premature learning. May a better fate
be reserv’d for <span class="smcap">Le Fancois</span>, a youth
of fourteen, who, as I hear, has acquir’d
a high reputation amongst the
French, by his genius and extraordinary
erudition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>I have often seen with concern the
children of peasants loaded with labour
above their age and strength, but
a still worse error is committed, when
the mind of a child is forc’d to apply
before the time, and beyond its abilities;
and this is generally productive
of the worst consequences, for the
powers of the mind brought to maturity
by a pernicious art, are short-liv’d,
and soon grow old: and who
has not with grief seen children of the
brightest hopes, hardly give proofs of
common understanding, when grown
up? The earth is a long time prepar’d
to admit seed, and before it is sown,
receives that strength, which afterwards
impregnates it with fertility from
the sun, the air, and the plough; then
the grain springs up, vegetates, flourishes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
and brings good fruits to maturity.</p>

<p>But if early studies are hurtful, it is
no less dangerous to attach oneself to
study in an advanc’d age; for habit
becomes gradually a second nature
when we begin from our tender age;
but at an advanc’d period it is no
longer susceptible of new habits; and
the fibres of the brain accustom’d to
rest, are torn before they can receive
new and regular motions. I not long
since with difficulty cur’d a native of
this country, who in his fortieth year
laying aside mercantile business, to
pore night and day over the works of
<span class="smcap">Newton</span>, <span class="smcap">Clarke</span> and <span class="smcap">Locke</span>, had
totally disorder’d his brain. He recovered
his health by remedies, by a
cessation of study, and amusing conversation;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
but the joy was but short-liv’d,
for by again dipping into the sublime,
geometry, and metaphysical abstractions,
he once more lost his senses<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is it less laborious to continue
our accustom’d studies too long, when
old age approaches. The soul that
animates our bodies, is indeed immortal;
but so long as it is connected with
a feeble frame, it must be influenc’d
by its nature.</p>

<p class="noindent">But it grieves me, respectable auditors,
that you should be obliged to hear of
so many disorders, and I to give an
account of them; so I shall say no
more of so melancholy a subject, but
proceed to treat of the remedies for
the several diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>What lover ever had eyes to see
the blemishes of his mistress? What
lover ever ceas’d to admire his mistress’s
beauty? This is another pernicious
effect of learning; it occasions a
sourness of temper. Philosophers think
themselves wise in every thing; ’tis a
difficult matter to persuade them that
they every day injure their health by
their manner of living; you may advise,
intreat, and even scold them, it
will be all to no purpose; they impose
upon themselves a thousand different
ways; some by too great a confidence
in their strength, others by the hopes
of impunity from the punishments being
delayed; others again by the deceitful
defence of the power of habit,
and others again by the still more deceitful
example of other men’s good
luck; others by other motives; and all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
by that steady adherence to their purpose,
which they think becoming in
a man of virtue, are so blinded, that
they are not affected by future sufferings,
and hardly even by those they
have already incurred. I shall not
however neglect my duty as a monitor,
and if I should fail of success, it will
be at least some merit to have attempted
in a design of so much utility.
Preservatives are to be offered
to such of the studious as are still in
health, and remedies to those who
have impair’d their constitutions.</p>

<p>The sure and only preservative is
for the mind to be often unemploy’d,
and the body to labour. This does
not hold with regard to all men of
learning; there are some whose meditations
should be disturb’d upon no account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
whatever. <span class="smcap">Descartes</span> frames
a world, <span class="smcap">Newton</span> revolves the whole
system of the universe in his mind,
<span class="smcap">Montesquieu</span> makes laws for all nations;
let no body interrupt them, let
all nature be silent, they labour for us,
let the good of the people be the supreme
law; they were born to cultivate
those studies. But how few are
there, whose labours are of such consequence?
Most studious men lose
their time, and break their constitutions
to no purpose; one makes a collection
of common-place topicks, another
embellishes such as are threadbare,
a third anxiously investigates matters
of no utility, others make trifles
the subject of laborious researches, and
all are equally unmindful of the unprofitableness
and danger of their pursuits.
But be vigilant for their good;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
knock at their doors; rouse them from
their lethargy; make them, whether
they will or no, lay aside their studies
for hours together, and let their minds
not be totally abandoned to idleness,
but recreated by gentle ease, whilst
their strength is restored by exercise.
At the beginning of my discourse I
displayed the advantages of exercise:
let it therefore be observed as an inviolable
rule by the learned, to dedicate
an hour or two every day to walking,
that the lungs may be recreated
by a free use of the air, that the stagnant
humours may be thrown off, perspiration
renewed, the limbs strengthened,
and the nerves repaired. <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>
chose for this purpose the hour
before dinner. Nor is walking alone
sufficient. I would likewise recommend
riding, which acts admirably upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
the head and lungs, and above all upon
the abdominal viscera, by repeatedly
agitating them; as likewise all the other
exercises, which were carefully cultivated
both by the ancients and our
ancestors; but which we, to our great
detriment, have neglected. Let us not
forget <span class="smcap">Herodicus</span>, a man of learning,
endowed with extraordinary intellectual
faculties, but the most infirm of all
mortals, who by exercise alone so confirmed
his health, that he lived entirely
free from disorders to a hundred years
of age, and composed a treatise upon
the gymnastic art. Let us not forget
<span class="smcap">Socrates</span>, the wisest of mankind,
who thought it worth his while to
learn this art. <span class="smcap">Strato</span>, being troubled
with the spleen, had recourse to
exercise, which cured him. <span class="smcap">Hysmonæus</span>,
being afflicted with a weakness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
of the nerves, had recourse to the olympic
games, and by that exercise overcame
the disorder. Sailing should have
its share of praise, amongst other sorts
of exercise, whose power in removing
the obstructions of the viscera, throwing
off the bile, restoring the lungs, renewing
perspiration, and strengthening
the fibres, the ancients were well
acquainted with: and it has lately been
demonstrated by the illustrious <span class="smcap">Gilchrist</span>,
and was likewise preferred to
all other sorts of carriage by <span class="smcap">Augustus
Cæsar</span>, who, when he had any
occasion to travel, chose rather to go
by sea than otherwise, if it was possible.
<span class="smcap">Augustus Cæsar</span> may in many respects
be compared to the studious and
learned; “eloquentiam enim studiaque
liberaliora ab ætate prima &amp;
cupide &amp; laboriosissime exercuit; &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
graves valetudines per omnem vitam
expertus est; &amp; distillationibus, &amp;
rheumaticis doloribus, &amp; calculo obnoxius
vixit, &amp; præcordiorum inflatione
aliquoties tentabatur; litteratis
vero sapientior;” “for he cultivated
eloquence and the liberal
arts from his early youth with taste
and diligence, and was during his
whole life a valetudinarian; he was
troubled with catarrhs, rheumatic
pains, and the stone, and was
sometimes likewise attacked with an
inflammation of the parts about the
heart; but, being more prudent than
most men of learning, <i>he took great
care of his valetudinary constitution</i><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.”
Riding in an easy chariot is of little
service; of still less the easy succussions
of the several machines which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
have been invented by modern industry
for moving the sick about in their
chambers; but I set a high value upon
all those plays or diversions which oblige
a man to exercise both his arms;
such, for example, are shuttle-cock, and
others of the like nature.</p>

<p>Do not be concerned, my worthy
auditors; the time which you devote
to recreation is not lost to learning;
you will presently apply to your studies
with renewed alacrity, and, whilst
your strength and health are preserved,
a long life will abundantly recompense
the hours dedicated to the care of the
body. In leisure likewise those sublime
ideas may rise, which the obscurity
of your musæum would for ever
have suppressed, <i>for lively and vigorous
geniuses make the more noble efforts, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
more intervals of leisure they allow themselves</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
I have a particular friend,
who, in his walks in the country, has
composed books that will immortalize
his name; <i>for the souls of those who
walk under the canopy of heaven are
exalted</i>: and <span class="smcap">Pliny</span> the younger observes,
<i>that it is surprizing to what a
degree the soul is rous’d by the agitation
and motion of the body</i>: close confinement
contracts the body, the oil of the
lamp, as it were, infects the thoughts
by its smell, and by too intense study
we become incapable of application.
<span class="smcap">Plutarch</span> has an ingenious observation,
that as plants are nourished by
moderate watering, but overwhelmed
by too much, so the soul is improved
by moderate studies, but overpowered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
by excessive studies<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. Take my advice
therefore, you men of learning;
you will one day repent your austere
retirement; but it will be too late to
look for a remedy when the danger
is at hand; and foresight becomes the
wise man: don’t think to excuse your
dangerous errors; the experiment is not
made upon a vulgar soul, the life of a
man of learning is at stake; neither
alledge, in excuse for yourselves, the
examples of others; nor your own
strength, which you break every day;
nor vain custom, for we can never use
ourselves to a disease; nor the impunity
of your early years, for reiterated
strokes will break what one alone could
not. Lay aside, therefore, the agitations
of your minds, and exercise your
bodies; for exercise is of so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
service to the mind, that <span class="smcap">Hoffman</span><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
has by its means made stupid men
attain to a degree of understanding;
and do not despise the health of the
body, with the assistance of which the
labour of the mind will become more
supportable; for the powers of the
mind grow dull, if the strength of the
body is in a wavering unsettled state.
Physicians have power over souls;
and <span class="smcap">Descartes</span> has justly observed,
“Animum adeo a temperamento &amp;
organorum corporis dispositione
pendere, ut si ratio aliqua possit inveniri,
quæ homines sapientiores &amp;
ingeniosiores reddat quam hactenus
fuerit, credendum sit illam in medicina
quæri debere.” “That the
soul depends so much upon the
constitution and disposition of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
corporeal organs, that, if there could
be a method found to render men
wise and ingenious, it seems probable
that it should be sought in
physick<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.” There is a regimen
calculated for the studious, of which
I shall now give a succinct account<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span> in three words expresses
the whole alimentary diet of all
ages, all ranks of men, and all conditions,
ὡς ὁ πονος εστι και ἡ τροφη, food
should be as labour; for, as he says
elsewhere, if the aliments are overcome,
that is, if they are subdued by
the powers of the body, they invigorate
it; if they overcome it, that
is, when they get the better of the
digestive powers, they give rise to
many bad effects: and <span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>
justly observes from <span class="smcap">Hippocrates</span>,
that health arises from the exact equality
of bodily exercise and the aliments
taken. The reason is, the body by its
own force makes its own juices and
humours out of the aliments it uses:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
nor is its state the same in the robust
ploughman and enfeebled doctor.
Whilst the former, by incessant exercise,
by breathing every day the wholesome
country air, by a chearful and
vacant mind, unembarrassed by perplexing
meditations, and by soft slumbers
continually repairs his strength,
he can bear any sort of food; the
salival, gastric, intestinal, and bilious
liquors, elaborated to the highest perfection,
thoroughly dissolve the most
glutinous fat, and even salt pork hardened
by smoke; the strength of the
muscles of the stomach and intestines
is unimpaired; they suffer nothing to
stay beyond its time in their cavities;
and as the aliments are digested, their
remains are thrown out. How different
from this is the case of the man
debilitated by study! The hard bowels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
of the mower can digest any thing,
the soft viscera of the learned or indolent
are incapable of digestion; the
latter therefore should maturely deliberate,
what his powers are equal to,
and what not.</p>

<p>Give the labouring man thin broth,
small cabbage, jellies, pullet’s flesh, or
white bread; the force of the viscera
and constant labour will soon digest
these, he will immediately grow hungry,
sweat all over, and in a short time
his strength will fail him, if it be not
soon repaired with fat bacon, hard
cheese, and black bread. But let this
food, or food of the like nature, be eaten
by the weak inhabitants of cities, who
are unequal to the labour of digesting
it, dreadful diseases will soon arise from
thence, the aliments being converted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
into poison. These are golden words
of <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>: “Eruditi viri (inquit)
nolunt gulæ temperare, &amp;
audent eadem edere quæ rustici,
verum non ferunt hunc victum;
optent, aut feriari a studiis, aut a
duris cibis.” “Men of learning,
says he, will not live temperately;
but are so indiscreet as to eat the
same food that labouring men do,
and which they are not able to bear;
so they should wish either to be
exempted from the necessity of studying,
or from that of eating strong
food<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>,” which if they continue
to live upon, there arise obstinate obstructions
in the abdominal viscera.</p>

<p>The strength of the aliments is estimated
not by the nature of the food<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
alone, but by its quantity: it is not
therefore enough to be choice in the
quality; attention should likewise be
given to the quantity of the food.
I will assert with confidence, that an
error in either respect is attended with
very bad consequences; but it is worst
of all when it relates to the quantity.
A due observation of the bodies of
learned men will shew what aliments
should be chosen, and what avoided:
to enumerate all the various sorts would
be tedious and disagreeable; it will be
sufficient to mention the principal
kinds.</p>

<p>All fat, viscid aliments, all aliments
puffed with wind, or hardened either
by art or nature, are hurtful. The
ancients condemned all sorts of pulse;
and <span class="smcap">Pythagoras</span> strictly forbid his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
disciples to eat beans, as these have an
extraordinary flatulency, highly destructive
of the tranquillity of mind
necessary to one who investigates truth.
Every body knows, that whilst the
stomach swells the mind is depressed
with languor, and becomes incapable
of performing its functions. The tender
flesh of all young animals is of great
service, except those of swine and geese;
not when boiled in copious broth, for
then they are deprived of their nutritious
juices, but when roasted, or boiled
in a small quantity of water. Such roots
are wholesome as consist of a light
flour, not without a mixture of salt
or sugar<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>; soft herbs, which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
neither too acid nor too emollient.
Nor should the several sorts of seeds be
denied their praise; nor ripe fruit, concerning
the use of which, however, a
caution should be observed; for they
relax, dissolve, cause acidity, and thereby
are the less fit for studious men.
But take notice, amongst the most
severe disorders of the learned are
reckoned the stagnation, the thickening,
and the hardening of the bile,
which defeats are best remedied by fruits
that swell with saponaceous juices, as
cherries, strawberries, rasberries, gooseberries,
peaches, grapes, pears, and
other fruits of the like nature, which
studious, sedentary men cannot well
do without, especially in summer.
Care should be taken to prevent their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
being detrimental, by eating them
when the stomach is empty, either
with or without bread, and long before
and long after having drunk wine; for
thus they neither disturb the digestion
of the other aliments, nor, being hardened
with wine, prove more difficult
of digestion themselves, nor are turned
into a sourness, but act like a mild
and gently stimulating soap, resolve
concretions, accelerate the course of
the bile, stimulate the sluggish intestines,
and, by removing obstinate
costiveness, put an end to grievous disorders,
and either prevent hypochondriac
melancholy, with the matter
from whence it arises, or cure it.
They are of great service to those,
whom severe study throws into inflammatory
disorders, or slow fevers,
proceeding from a drying up of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
humours: but they are hurtful when,
the strength being broken, the fibres
have lost their tone, and the fluids are
too thin. Eggs boiled in such a manner
as to be supped are also very good
for them; for these, being inspissated
by boiling, mix with the harder aliments.
Well-baked bread and decoctions
of bread are also of service to
them. Milk is wholesome, provided
it does not grow acid in the stomach.
Chocolate deserves to be recommended;
for with its soft flour and penetrating
oil, and a sort of gentle bitter
irritating taste, it soon repairs and restores
the strength: do not, however,
use it to excess; it is a very nutritious
aliment, and increases plethora in those
of a plethoric disposition; it is fat, and
by too great lubrication renders the
stomach and intestines incapable of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
being stimulated, so that neither does
the stomach grow hungry, nor are the
excrements voided: it moreover grows
acid, and causes a gnawing of the stomach.
Various dishes, which may
be made out of these by a judicious
and prudent mixture, are very wholesome;
but it is better to use only simple
food, either raw or boiled.</p>

<p>Relaxed fibres, quite benumbed by
a sedentary life, sometimes require a
gentle stimulus; therefore a mild seasoning
is not to be disapproved of, as
salt, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg; and
such agreeable aromaticks of our own
country as every man cultivates in his
garden, thyme, sweet-marjoram, fennil,
chervil, and others of the like
nature: but those are to be avoided
which stimulate with a sharp salt or
oil, that nature can scarcely overcome.
I hate garlick as much as <span class="smcap">Horace</span>
himself; nor do I better like pepper
and mustard, which are pernicious for
their parching oils: but I advise you,
however, not to make an immoderate
use of the milder sort of seasonings, but
use them as remedies, and not for a
constancy; for their frequent irritation
increases frictions, wastes the fibres,
and shortens life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>There are other helps to digestion,
and the chief of these is exact mastication,
which greatly forwards the
work of the stomach: this is highly recommended
by physicians; but slighted
by others very foolishly, and greatly
to their own prejudice. It both increases
the secretion of the saliva,
which is the best menstruum of the
aliments, and, whilst it divides the
latter into minute particles, it increases
their superficies, whence they are
more easily penetrated by the gastric
juices; consequently there is a quicker
digestion, a more compleat solution,
no spontaneous corruption, no irritating
of the stomach. Therefore let not
the learned despise mastication, or rather
not forget it, whilst at their meals
they are, by a pernicious habit, intent
upon other things: whether they read<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
or meditate, the stomach suffers, because
the nerves languish when the
mind thinks attentively, and experience
proves to the very eyes themselves,
that digestion is badly performed
when the nerves languish; for
upon binding the nerves of the stomach,
the illustrious <span class="smcap">Haller</span>, who
made so many extraordinary discoveries,
often saw the aliments totally
corrupted, instead of being digested.</p>

<p>Digestion is performed slowly in
men of learning, therefore fresh aliments
should seldom be given them;
because the state of the stomach is very
different when it is half full of undigested
aliments, from what it is when
entirely void of aliments, and overflowed
with the gastric fluids, ready
for the use of concoction. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
to make three meals a day, one somewhat
considerable, the other two rather
slight, will be sufficient for men
of learning. The following order with
regard to eating, or rather living,
pleases me highly, and is recommended
by the experience of numbers: Upon
rising in the morning a studious
person should drink a glass of pure
water; in about an hour after he
should breakfast; six hours after he
should dine, having first past one hour
in walking; after dinner he should
allow himself an hour or two of leisure,
because to sit down to study immediately
after eating is highly pernicious:
his supper should be light;
for this, there are reasons of the greatest
weight, because, as I observed before,
sleep occasions a dangerous plethora
in the head; therefore the fullness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of the vessels should not be increased
before sleep by too large a
meal<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>: add to this, that the functions
of the nerves are suspended during
the time of sleep, and they cannot perform
digestion; at last a soft and refreshing
slumber is produced by the absence
of all irritation: but if the stomach is
overloaded with aliments, the sleep is
interrupted, as the nerves are continually
affected by the irritation of digestion.
Hence a plentiful supper
causes a heaviness in the head, sleep is
disturbed, digestion interrupted, the
strength impaired, and the health entirely
destroyed. But a Platonic supper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
is praised, because it is not only
agreeable at the time, but the day
following.</p>

<p class="noindent">Most learned professors, you well know
him, whom as a colleague you all
loved, that eminent man, who, when
he had broke his constitution by a
profound study of antiquities, history,
and both the civil and common
law, restored it considerably by the
simple remedy of supping upon milk.</p>

<p>Not to sup at all, however, is dangerous;
for the nerves of the learned
are moveable, and easily irritated; and
if the chyle is not soon renewed by a
supply of new aliments, such is the
acrimony of the blood, already often
subdued by the strength of the viscera,
that it is an irritation of the nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
which totally destroys the sleep. The
example of <span class="smcap">Augustus Cæsar</span>, who
was very moderate in eating, is very
properly proposed to the learned, as is
likewise that of the illustrious <span class="smcap">Lewis
Cornaro</span>, who restored his ruined
health by a regular diet alone; and
eating but the fourth part of the quantity
of victuals eaten by his fellow-citizens,
lived to an advanced age, vigorous
and chearful. Long since <span class="smcap">Bartholus</span>,
one of the most eminent
lawyers, and a man well versed in polite
literature, reduced the quantity of
his food and liquor to a certain weight,
and by that means preserved his intellectual
faculties unimpaired during the
whole course of his life<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. A regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
diet is capable of effecting every
thing: studious men, however, whilst
they take care of their health, ought
not to forget, that a man, who is well,
should not so confine himself to rules,
as not to break through them, when
he thinks proper: for a constant habit
is real slavery: and I have known several
learned and studious men, who
were so scrupulous with regard to
their hours of eating and going to bed,
that their minds seemed to be chained
to their bodies, which is the most
shameful sort of servitude: nor can he
be said to be either a lover of virtue
or of learning, who cannot pursue his
studies if he be obliged to wait a little
longer than usual for his meals, if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
has not slept quite enough, or if the
air be too hot or too cold.</p>

<p>I have hitherto spoke only of solid
food; liquors are not to be forgotten.
In the last age a grievous
error crept into physic, that health is
the better, the more fluid the blood
is; and by the advice of <span class="smcap">Bontekoe</span>
chiefly a pernicious custom prevailed
of drinking warm liquors both night
and day, whereby the human species
has greatly suffered, and those of the
present age sorely lament the injury
which their forefathers sustained in the
last, by impairing the strength of their
nerves.</p>

<p>Grave authors, who knew better,
and chiefly the illustrious <span class="smcap">Duncan</span>,
with <span class="smcap">Boerhaave</span>, and the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
school of Leyden, have proscribed this
error; and, if they have not reformed the
abuse, have at least greatly checked it.
But most valetudinarians still lie under
the same prepossession, and, looking
upon an over thick blood as the source
of their disorders, have recourse to
warm beverages, which others reject.
It can scarce be told, it can scarce be
believed, how many disorders proceed
from this source: and I will take upon
me to assert, that those pernicious
bowls, overflowing with warm liquors,
are the true box of Pandora, without
even hope remaining at the bottom;
for they are prolific sources of hypochondriac
melancholy, which both
adds strength to and is itself one of the
worst of disorders. Nor is it to be
wondered at, if warm beverages are
more hurtful to studious men, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
are naturally weak and feeble, than to
others; for they are not troubled with
an over thick, but, on the contrary,
with too thin a blood. You are well
aware, respectable auditors, that the
density of the blood is as the motion
of the solids: the fibres of the learned
are relaxed, their motions are slow,
and their blood of consequence thin.
Bleed a ploughman and a doctor at
the same time: from the first there
will flow a thick blood, resembling
inflammatory blood, almost solid, and
of a deep red; the blood of the second
will be either of a faint red, or without
any colour, soft, gelatinous, and will
almost entirely turn to water. Your
blood therefore, men of learning, should
not be dissolved, but brought to a
consistence; and you should in general
be moderate in the article of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
drinking, and cautiously avoid warm
liquors.</p>

<p>The blood flows with difficulty in
weak persons, stagnates, obstructs, not
on account of its own density, but by
the feeble contraction of the vessels,
which is increased by hard drinking.
The stomach first feels the disorder;
because the liquors prepared by nature
for the business of digestion, being immersed
in the liquors that are drank,
become unable to perform their functions,
and the food is imperfectly dissolved
on account of the imperfection
of the menstruums. The fibres of the
stomach, being too much stretched,
at first give pain, and soon after lose
their force, and become unable to push
forward the aliments: they therefore
load the stomach by being stopped:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
to cure which the sick persons again
have recourse to drinking, which with
the force of a torrent drives these half-digested
aliments to the intestines. All
these symptoms grow worse if warm
beverages are drank; for this is the
force of heat, it both relaxes the fibres,
and, by more powerfully dissolving the
phlegm, occasions more severe pains in
the stomach.</p>

<p>Amongst the favourite beverages of
the learned, the worst is the infusion
of that famous leaf, so well known by
the name of tea, which, to our great
detriment, has every year, for these
two centuries past, been constantly imported
from China and Japan. This
most pernicious gift first destroys the
strength of the stomach, and, if it be
not soon laid aside, equally destroys that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
of the viscera, the blood, the nerves;
and of the whole body; so that malignant
and all chronical disorders will
appear to increase, especially nervous
disorders, in proportion as the use of
tea becomes common: and you may
easily form a judgment from the diseases
that prevail in every country,
whether the inhabitants of it are lovers
of tea, or the contrary. How happy
would it be for Europe, if by unanimous
consent the importation of this infamous
leaf were prohibited, which is
endued only with a corrosive force, derived
from the acrimony of the gum
with which it is pregnant: for experience
shews, that what it has of an astringent
principle is lost in the warm water.</p>

<p>I will not pass the same censure,
though I must pass some censure, upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
that celebrated beverage coffee,
which both hurts by the power of the
warm water, and by irritating; for
nature cannot use itself to irritation
without suffering. It is however rendered
powerful by a nutritious flour,
and by a bitter and strengthening aromatic
oil; so that it may well be laid
up in apothecaries shops as an useful
remedy, but is improperly used in kitchens
as part of our daily food. It
raises the spirits, eases the stomach
when loaded with phlegm, cures the
head-ach, causes a chearfulness of
mind, and, if we may believe some
people, increases its penetration; for
which reason the learned are so fond
of it. But was coffee used by <span class="smcap">Homer</span>,
<span class="smcap">Thucidides</span>, <span class="smcap">Plato</span>, <span class="smcap">Xenophon</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lucretius</span>, <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, <span class="smcap">Ovid</span>, <span class="smcap">Horace</span>,
<span class="smcap">Petronius</span>, and the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
great men of antiquity, who as much
excelled us in genius, as we surpass
them in experience and knowledge of
nature.</p>

<p>Warm liquors being therefore justly
set aside, cold water should be used,
which has as much power in strengthening
as the former in weakening the
body.</p>

<p>Wine deserves its share of praise;
but I have the same opinion concerning
wine, with respect to the learned,
that I have in regard to coffee, that it
should be used as a remedy, and not
as a drink. The Creator gave pure
water as the universal drink, which he
made a menstruum to all sorts of food,
and agreeable to all palates: it should
be chosen cold, soft, and mild; for it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
both strengthens and cleanses the viscera.
Hence it has been generally
looked upon as a panacea both by the
Greeks and Romans, and it is the best
of remedies when dryness prevails, or
bile or acidity are in too great quantity<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.
Digestion will be more easy,
sleep sweeter, the head seldomer clouded,
and the strength greater, if, laying
aside wine, we quench our thirst
with pure water alone.</p>

<p>Wine has one fault that renders it
exceeding hurtful to the learned; it
forces the blood into the brain, and
increases the several disorders thereof,
head-achs, megrim, and the like, which
are hardly to be cured without laying
aside the use of wine: all these disorders
are wonderfully removed by drinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
water, which prevents too great a quantity
of blood from being gathered in the
head. What wonder is it then if it increases
the intellectual powers, and if
those who drink water alone have a
more tenacious memory, a more lively
imagination, and quicker perceptions
than others. The abstemiousness of
<span class="smcap">Demosthenes</span> is a great example in
favour of drinking water, which has
likewise this virtue, it in a surprising
manner subdues those catarrhs with
which the learned are so often troubled,
and which the use of wine is
apt to increase. They have often acid
eructations; but wine sharpens an acidity,
water dulls it.</p>

<p>I will solemnly own, that I have
cured more nervous disorders, (and
learned men are generally troubled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
with such) by retrenching the quantity
of liquor, forbidding all warm
beverages, as well as wine, and recommending
exercise, than by any
other remedies. Nor should the danger
of leaving off what people have
been used to, be alledged: there is no
such danger; or, if there be, it is easily
avoided by a gradual disuse.</p>

<p>But take notice, if sometimes the
too great laxity of the stomach, the
great weakness of the body, and the
depression of the spirits, require a remedy
to brace, to strengthen, to excite,

<p class="noindent">But avoid those small wines which have
less of the nature of wine than vinegar,
and rather irritate than strengthen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Remember that wine is an antidote
against the miseries of life and the tediousness
of idleness; cares are banished
by wine, whilst the reason is intoxicated:
but does such a drink become
the learned? And this puts me
in mind of another sort of intoxication,
I mean that caused by smoking tobacco,
which abounds with an acrimonious
salt and sulphur, together
with a narcotic oil. I have elsewhere
enlarged upon the folly of smoking;
here I shall add more concisely, that
the narcotic principle hurts the stomach,
causes a stuffing up of the head,
head-achs, vertigos, anxiety, lethargy,
apoplexy, and finally all the effects of
opium, as the great Lord <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> has
observed. <i>Tobacco</i>, says he, <i>the use of
which herb has greatly prevailed in the
present age, is a species of henbane; it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
evident that it disturbs the head like
opiates</i>. Therefore, young men, avoid
a dirty pleasure, equally injurious both
to your health and your studies, and
which should be left to those who
have recourse to it for the killing of
time. The muses fly those studies
that smell like a stable, and delight
in a purer air; for one of the chief
sources of health or sickness is the air
which environs us, in which we live,
and by which not only our bodies are
affected, but whose power our very
minds experience. Thus the air of
Bœotia, or Thrace, rendered dull those
whom that of Athens revived:</p>

<p>Prudent men will chuse as pure, as
warm, and as dry an air as they can;
for such an one, by giving strength to
the fibres, is salubrious to the lungs,
and promotes the circulation. A frigid
and dry air is supportable: a moist
air is highly pernicious, as by it all the
disorders of studious men are aggravated;
for it increases laxity, stops
perspiration, and occasions catarrhs,
pains, and palsies. Every man of learning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
has it not in his power to repair
to Baya or Alexandria, nor does it suit
them all to breathe the country air,
which is the purest; for there are
more that compile than think. The
country is not a proper place to pursue
such studies; but any man may chuse
a healthy habitation in town, and live
in a lightsome house, a high apartment,
refreshed by a breeze in summer,
and enlightened by the sun in
winter. He should take particular care
to have fresh air let into his chamber
every day; without this precaution he
lives upon the infected: it should be
cooled in summer, and not kept too
warm in winter; for the learned, like
all weak men, as was the case of
<span class="smcap">Augustus</span>, are ill able to bear excess
of heat or cold: too great a heat relaxes
the nerves, but intense cold causes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
convulsions. In the dog-days we become
unfit for labour, as also in the
severe cold of winter; and the more
tender the constitution, the less it is
able to withstand the weather. Such
was that of <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, whose nerves
were relaxed to such a degree in the
heat of summer, that he<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> was almost
reduced to a state of imbecillity.
But the air should be warmed in winter,
a fire being kindled for the purpose;
for this fresh air succeeds the
corrupt air that goes off; nor do exhalations
remain, nor does the head
grow warm, nor do the feet become
cold, which is of great consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Cold in the feet hurts the weak by
causing pains in the head, the throat,
and the breast; it disorders digestion,
causes dreadful colicks, obstructs perspiration,
and prevents sleep to a very
great degree. I have often cured men
of note, who had long been without
sleep, though they had recourse to the
most efficacious remedies, by advising
them to warm the soles of their feet
at a fire, every night before they went
to bed, till the sense of heat became
painful. Others have been greatly relieved
by a gently stimulating plaster
applied to the soles of their feet, and
left on both night and day.</p>

<p>I may probably, respectable auditors,
appear to descend too much to particulars,
and to dwell too long upon
trifles; but nothing is little or inconsiderable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
in physick: and it is a thing
of so much importance to keep the
blood from the heads of men of learning,
that they should neglect nothing
which may contribute to this end.
They should therefore take care not to
keep it warm with too much covering,
or rather they should use themselves
to go bare-headed from their childhood.
Some men of learning have
been so bold as to wrap their heads
with a towel dipt in cold water, that
they might be able to continue the
longer at their studies: and what will
not an inordinate desire of knowledge
excite men to? Such rashness should
be avoided; but it is of service to all,
and especially to studious, sedentary
men, to wash their ears, their faces,
and their whole heads, hair and all,
every morning in cold water. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
very good for the <i>literati</i>, when they feel
the blood forced up into their heads,
not to walk, or inquire sollicitously
after medicines, but to sit upon their
chair in total inaction, without ever
uttering a word.</p>

<p>The same necessity of keeping the
blood from the head should prevent
the learned from indulging in sleep
after dinner; or, if they should sometimes
be forced to yield to sleep, let
them imitate the illustrious personage,
so often mentioned already, <span class="smcap">Augustus
Cæsar</span>, <i>who with the cloaths and
shoes he had on took a short nap, having
covered his eyes with his hand</i><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
must likewise add this caution, that
they should never compose themselves
to sleep, without first unbinding all
their ligatures. To wash their feet in
warm water is likewise of great service
to them.</p>

<p>These are the chief helps by the
assistance of which the learned will be
enabled to prevent the ill effects of
study; but when their application has
produced real disorders, they will have
occasion for other remedies. You will
sometimes see them, when nature is
quite exhausted by study, fall into a
consumption: then the severity of the
disorder requires some efficacious remedy;
and the best is entirely to lay
aside study, meditation, and books, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
bid a long farewell to their musæums,
and, giving themselves up to leisure,
chearfulness, and country pleasures, to
think of restoring their bodies alone,
without troubling their heads about
cultivating their minds; but let them
become what men were designed for
by nature, ploughmen or gardeners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>How sure should we be of curing
the disorders of men of learning, if it
were possible to lull thought asleep.
Here generous wines are of great service,
provided the lungs are still unaffected,
and a slow heat does not burn
up the veins. Wholesome meats, and
well boiled aliments, are of great service:
milk is likewise of great service,
provided the stomach is able to
bear it. Riding is also useful. And
it may be beneficial to purge away
the peccant matter by some gentle,
strengthening remedy. <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> recommends
rhubarb. <span class="smcap">Celsus</span>, with
more reason as I apprehend, recommended
aloes, the use of which is of
great service to the learned. Let them
not, however, abuse an excellent remedy;
for, though purges are sometimes
necessary, they are dangerous
when too frequently used: for the body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
begins to be disused to nourishment,
and must of consequence grow weak.
But beware, you sick men, of too violent
purging remedies; because, as the
intestines are often covered with mucus,
this mucus is generally soft, and
easily removed; when it is removed,
a softer sort succeeds in its place; this
badly defends the villous coat of the
intestines; and, when it is left without
defence, it either occasions incessant
pains, or should be continually fomented
by the tenderest sort of food.</p>

<p>The Peruvian bark or kinkina is
here of the greatest efficacy imaginable;
in this case there is not a better
remedy; it restores digestion, strengthens
the vessels, compresses the fluids,
promotes secretions, and, above all,
perspiration, repairs the strength of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
nerves, and quells false motions. One
of our most eminent geometricians
soon repaired his wasted powers by a
large draught of the decoction of kinkina,
which he had constantly by his
side.</p>

<p>If the constitution be not yet entirely
broke, weakness oppresses the stomach
and the nerves, the learned are
troubled with hysteric symptoms, often
attended with a vertigo, fainting fits,
suffocation, and anxiety. They are
to be cured like women who are troubled
with hysterics, occasioned by
mobility and want of tone in the fibres;
they are to be cured, I say, by bitters,
ferulacious gums, myrrh, steel, and
the cold bath. The frequent use of
the latter preserves a good state of
health, and repairs a broken constitution;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
for it is efficacious above all other
remedies, except there be already an
extraordinary degree of weakness, in
strengthening the stomach, the nerves,
and the whole body; it restores sleep,
produces a chearfulness and serenity of
mind, and supplies new strength to pursue
new studies. This made the ancients
set so high a value upon it, that,
even amidst the avocations of their
necessary business, they never failed to
bathe every day: and I most earnestly
recommend to the literati the frequent
use of bathing. I am not ignorant
that the ancients often used the warm
bath, but they used it as a remedy
after exercise or fatigue; and it generally
agrees very well with the robust
and active; but they restored their
strength with cold baths. <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>,
who received no benefit from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
warm bath, when affected with great
weakness of body, was advised to have
recourse to the cold bath by <span class="smcap">Antonius
Musa</span>. Cold baths are salutary
to delicate constitutions, and the health
of the learned is generally, though not
always, as much hurt by bathing in
warm water, as promoted by bathing
in cold.</p>

<p>Friction in a great measure produces
the same effects with bathing; for if
the whole lower belly of a person,
whilst he lies supine in bed in the
morning, with bent knees and an
empty stomach, be rubbed all over
with a rough cloth, he will be greatly
benefited by it: by this artifice the
motion in the abdomen is increased,
the stagnant juices are thrown out, the
secretions are increased, the excrements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
are prevented from staying too long in
the body, and innumerable diseases are
cured, which, as you have been frequently
told, are caused by a slow
circulation. If the skin is rubbed all
over, either with a cloth or a flesh-brush,
the cuticular secretion is greatly
promoted, the circulation of the blood
is so quickened, that a violent fever
may be caused by rubbing alone, the
motion is increased in the smallest
vessels, the strength is repaired, and
the ills caused by want of exercise are
partly remedied. The ancients were
therefore right in setting a great value
upon friction: it was afterwards unhappily
neglected; but the English
physicians revived it with great success;
and there is no class of men to whom
it may be of greater service than to the
studious. I would, however, recommend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
to them not to use this kind of
exercise till they have read what <span class="smcap">Celsus</span>
and <span class="smcap">Galen</span> have written concerning
it.</p>

<p>There is another sort of remedy,
which is often of the highest service
to men of learning, I mean chalybeate
waters; but they should not send for
them, they should go where they are
to be drunk at the fountain head.
I do not indeed despise those that are
sent for; nay, I have known men of
learning who, by my advice, drank
Seltzer waters at home during the
whole year, by which, and remitting
somewhat of their application, they
recovered their health. But it is still
better to drink them at their source,
for they are there in greater perfection;
and the journey is of service, because,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
whilst it lasts, the sick are exempt
from all domestick cares, are amused
with a variety of objects, enjoy agreeable
company, relax their minds, and
recreate their bodies: and the journey
alone is of so much service, that hypochondriac
persons are often cured
by visiting remote libraries.</p>

<p>It would be as useless as it is impossible
to enumerate all the waters
that may be of service in repairing
broken constitutions; for what nature
intended as a most salutary remedy,
it has liberally bestowed upon most
regions. There are many in Switzerland;
those of Aquia in Savoy, in my
neighbourhood, deserve high praises;
our waters of Rotula are still more to
be recommended on account of the
agreeableness of the place than their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
salubrious qualities; we must not forget
those of Lausanne, the virtues of
which have been demonstrated to me
both by analysis and frequent observation;
but the Seltzer waters surpass
them all, at least in their reputation,
if not in their qualities; those of
Schwalbach and Spaw are still more
powerful; and the Pyrmont waters
are inferior to none.</p>

<p>These are not all, but the principal
remedies by which those disorders may
be cured which men of learning bring
upon themselves by over great application:
but their disorders are not occasioned
by study alone: as men they
are subject to all the disorders of men;
and then they should be treated according
to the rules laid down by
experience for curing each disorder.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Physicians, however, should never forget,
that the patient, whom they have
under their care, is a man of learning,
and cannot, of consequence, have
the same strength with which most
other men are endued: as they have
relaxed fibres and thin blood, they
are not so capable of bearing phlebotomy:
but the intestines are often
filled with a collection of filth, which
must be purged off; so that, as the
illustrious <span class="smcap">Ramazzini</span> has long since
observed, it is better to have recourse
to other evacuations with them than
to bleeding.</p>

<p>Care should be always taken of the
head of a learned patient, because it
is easily disturbed, and grows delirious.
This is of very bad consequence in
disorders; for peevishness increases,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
which few learned patients are without;
and, whilst the brain is agitated
by a delirium, the necessary action
of the nerves upon the body becomes
slow, and so the powers of nature,
which can alone effect a cure, are
destroyed.</p>

<p>If the patient was afflicted before
with nervous disorders, these soon
cause sufferings of a peculiar sort:
the learned, when they are ill, cannot
bear too much light, nor noise,
nor a crowd of spectators. I have
often seen, upon the fever’s beginning
to cease, new symptoms occur,
which appear to be very bad, but are
in fact only nervous.</p>

<p>Men of learning cannot well bear
strong and powerful remedies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>Their recovery is always tedious,
and it requires extraordinary care: the
strength returns slowly; the faculties
of the mind, above all, are long in a
wavering condition; and I have scarce
ever known a man of learning recover
out of a disorder, without complaining
of his memory’s being impaired,
and a sort of weakness of the head
discoverable in the face itself. Those
little consult their own interest, who
immediately return to their studies,
and that before their strength is renewed:
they prepare to themselves a
sore repentance: the ill consequences
are felt by their heads, their eyes,
and their stomachs, which must greatly
suffer, if, whilst they stand in need
of the assistance of the nerves, to digest
the remedies they take, the mind
should at so improper a time make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
use of them. I have often found, that
the exercises of the mind so weaken the
sensibility and motion of the stomach
and intestines, that the power of purgatives
is entirely counteracted by meditation
and constant study.</p>

<p>Learned patients, when just out of
a disorder, recover their sleep very
slowly, and it often is not to be recovered
without the assistance of wine,
which is of wonderful efficacy in this
case, by restoring a due tone to the
stomach, debilitated by warm liquors;
firmness to the nerves, strength to the
whole body, and spirits to the dejected
mind.</p>

<p>Thus have I laid open the causes
of disorders, their symptoms, and the
method of avoiding them: in fine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
I have compleated my design to the
best of my power; and you with joy
perceive my discourse approaching to
a conclusion, respectable auditors. I
am aware, however, that you will not
dismiss me, till I have atoned for a
grievous omission; nor do I intend to
disappoint your expectation: I shall
therefore now discover the grand arcanum
of the art of preserving health,
which I have hitherto concealed: attend
to my words. Chearfulness of
temper is the source of health, and a
virtuous life is the source of chearfulness:
a good conscience, a mind pure
and clear of all contagion, are the best
preservatives of health; and if the
learned were without them, it would
be a shame: for of what use is learning
without wisdom?</p>

taken up with moral contemplations,
and who, though they see
good, follow evil courses. Woe be
to them! they will suffer severely for
their bad conduct. Consider the force
of the passions: those which affect the
mind agreeably, promote a good state
of health; which those of a contrary
nature destroy. But what affects the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>

<p>Cruel remorse of conscience, on
the other hand, destroys the powers
both of mind and body; because the
mind being a prey to grief, such is
the will of the Author of nature, the
fibres are relaxed, and both health and
beauty vanish. I cannot without horror
recollect the shocking inquietudes
of some men, who, having abused the
gifts of God, could not, without inexpressible
terror, see death approach,
which renders the Deity more awful.
On the other hand, I cannot without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
joy revolve in my memory the happy
deaths of some good men, who, as
they had passed their whole lives in
the practice of virtue, returned with
joy to the Fountain of all good, having
laid aside their terrestrial covering,
and crowned a happy life with a joyful
death. How properly does the
learned doctor, lately professor of divinity
in this academy, occur to me
in this place, who, after having suffered
the cruel torments of a dreadful
disease, during the course of a twelvemonth,
with wonderful resolution and
patience, after a few friendly and
pious conversations with his wife and
children, whilst he testified his gratitude
to me for my care, and expressed
his good wishes, expired with
religious composure. And why should
I forget you, learned, dear, and now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
happy uncle and Mentor, who, having
lived your whole life, whilst in health,
as we promise to live when we are ill,
enjoying, to an advanced age, a conscience
void of offence, a genius replete
with vigour, and faculties acute
and penetrating; not only taught us
how to live virtuously, but likewise
have instructed us how to die well.</p>

<p>But it is time for me to put an end

ashamed to detain you any longer, respectable
auditors.</p>

whose friendship, having so often experienced,
I am so happy as to experience

you, without at the same time thinking
of that prince whom you represent

and this remembrance fills
me with emotion. For he is the
prince to whom I am indebted for
so many favours. It is he who recalled
me, out of love to my country,
when I was on the point of quitting
it at the invitation of a great monarch;
recalled me, I say; and, remembering
my attachment to physic,
founded this professorship, and bestowed
it upon me, not without the
most honourable tokens of his benevolence;
and, by enrolling me in
your illustrious assembly, learned professors,
he enabled me to address you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
by the dear appellation of colleagues.
Vouchsafe, therefore, favourably to
receive him whom he has given you
as a companion of your labours, and
receive me, most honoured colleagues,
in the same disposition of mind with
which I come towards you; and shew
as much benevolence, facility, and
readiness to assist me, as I am ready

<p>Citizens and strangers, illustrious

<p class="noindent">which I am sensible is but small, and
I am sorry for it; but, such as it is,
I entirely dedicate and consecrate it
to you. It will give me the highest
satisfaction, if it can be of any service
to you; but how would it grieve me,
if, by misunderstanding my discourse,
you should be hurt instead of being
benefited by it. Take care therefore,
virtuous youths; my design was to
shew the dangers of an obstinate perseverance
in study; but I was quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
silent with regard to the use of polite
learning, <i>which<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> nourishes youth,
delights old age, adorns prosperity, affords
consolation in adversity, delights
at home, is no hindrance abroad, passes
the night with us, travels with us, accompanies
us into the country</i>. I have
proved by examples, how dangerous
it is to fatigue the minds of children
with too great labour; but it was not
my intention to banish all labour and
study. “Nam certe quamlibet parum
sit, quod contulerit ætas prior,
majora tamen aliqua discet puer eo
ipso anno, quo minora didicisset.
Hoc per singulos annos prorogatum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
in summam proficit: &amp; quantum
in infantia præsumptum est temporis,
adolescentiæ acquiritur<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.”
“For though what is contributed by
the first age of life is but inconsiderable,
a boy will certainly
learn some things of consequence
in the very year that he learns
trifles. This, increasing every year,
will at last improve him, and what
is learned in infancy is an acquisition
to youth.” It is dangerous to
break upon the rocks of too great
learning; it is shameful to be wrecked
upon the opposite shore. What path
then must you tread? <i>Hac urget lupus,
hac canis angit.</i> <i>On one side the
wolf urges, on t’other the dog worries
us.</i> You will be safe in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>

what it would be proper for them to eat, and
what to drink. They will find from hence a
great assistance in moral philosophy; they will
likewise find from hence a great accession to
their intellectual faculties; they will become
more ingenious, have better memories, and be
more studious and wise. For besides the proper

chuse to reside in, what they should avoid.

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> In studious men, who lead a sedentary
life, whilst they grow pale with poring over
books, an apoplexy often arises from such a
cause; but it comes on slowly and gradually.
For the first symptom is languor, and a love
of indolence; then the understanding begins
to grow dull, the memory to flag; they become
sleepy, stupid, and often continue a long time
in that state before their death. I have seen,
and not without the greatest compassion, men
of the most profound learning, and who had
deserv’d highly of the republick of letters,
who, as it were, surviv’d themselves above a
twelvemonth in a state of total oblivion, and
